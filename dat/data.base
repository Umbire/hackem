abbathor
	Abbathor is the sole evil dwarven god, the great master of the
	greed and avarice that plagues so many of that otherwise noble
	race. He is a hunched, twisted creature, warped by his own
	greeds, jealousies, and desires. Like many other deities, his
	name is often invoked by followers of other gods to keep him away
	from one's treasure.
abbot
	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.
		[ The Runaway Abbot, by G. K. Chesterton ]
aerdrie faenya
	Aerdrie  Faenya is the elven goddess of air and weather. As a rain-
	bringer, she is revered as a source of fertility.  She is, however,
	perceived as a somewhat distant  goddess, and the fact that she  is
	also revered by some aarakocra slightly diminishes the  strength of
	elven  devotion to  her (as does  her definite  neutral tendency in
	alignment). The goddess  herself takes  delight in  the freedom  of
	the skies, the music  of wind instruments,  and (sometimes)  fairly
	severe and  violent thunderstorms. She is  friendly to all  avians,
	aarakocra, ki-rin, and lammasu.

	"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another
	boy and me. He was poor, and his only armor was a blanket his
	mother had made him from her hair. I, on the other hand, had
	a brand new suit of chain mail. Just before our joust, I asked
	him what he'd do if he made the team. (I was hoping to be more
	popular with the ladies.) He said he would be able to save the
	town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20
	brothers and sisters.

	Well, a sense of compassion came over me. I insisted we swap
	armor. He was forced to accept, as it would have been an
	insult not to do so.

	On the battlefield, we charged at each other and we both connected
	with our lances.

	Lying there on the mud mortally wounded, I learned what true armor
	class was that day."

~agate ring
agate*
	Translucent, cryptocrystalline variety of quartz and a subvariety
	of chalcedony.  Agates are identical in chemical structure to
	jasper, flint, chert, petrified wood, and tiger's-eye, and are
	often found in association with opal.  The colorful, banded rocks
	are used as a semiprecious gemstone and in the manufacture of
	grinding equipment.  An agate's banding forms as silica from
	solution is slowly deposited into cavities and veins in older
	rock.

	It was part of his profession to kill people.  He had never liked

	and forgot about it.  As a secret agent who held the rare double-O
	prefix -- the licence to kill in the Secret Service -- it was his
	duty to be as cool about death as a surgeon.  If it happened,
	it happened.  Regret was unprofessional -- worse, it was
	death-watch beetle in the soul.
		[ Goldfinger, by Ian Fleming ]
alchemy smock
    When worn, an alchemy smock provides 1 point of AC along with acid
    resistance, poison resistance and MC1 - despite the name, it has
    no actual effects on alchemy. Reading an alchemy smock will
    generate one of many YAFMs similarly to T-shirts, most of which are
    cooking-related.

    Due to limitations in how object extrinsics are defined, acid
    resistance from the alchemy smock is handled specially internally.
    As a result, it only applies to you: monsters wearing an alchemy
    smock will obtain poison resistance, but not acid resistance.
alchemist
	Humankind cannot gain anything without first giving something in
	return. To obtain, something of equal value must be lost. That is
	Alchemy's first law of Equivalent Exchange. In those days, we really
	believed that to be the world's one and only truth.

	can cast powerful spells.  They enjoy all of the strengths and
	weaknesses associated with being undead.

amulet
	"The complete Amulet can keep off all the things that make
	people unhappy -- jealousy, bad temper, pride, disagreeableness,
	greediness, selfishness, laziness.  Evil spirits, people called
	them when the Amulet was made.  Don't you think it would be nice
	to have it?"
	"Very," said the children, quite without enthusiasm.
	"And it can give you strength and courage."
	"That's better," said Cyril.
	"And virtue."
	"I suppose it's nice to have that," said Jane, but not with much
	interest.
	"And it can give you your heart's desire."
	"Now you're talking," said Robert.
		[ The Story of the Amulet, by Edith Nesbit ]
amulet of yendor
	This mysterious talisman is the object of your quest.  It is
	said to possess powers which mere mortals can scarcely
	comprehend, let alone utilize.  The gods will grant the gift of
	immortality to the adventurer who can deliver it from the
	depths of Moloch's Sanctum and offer it on the appropriate high
	altar on the Astral Plane.
amulet of drain resistance
	The amulet of drain resistance provides drain resistance.
	Prevents drain life attacks from monsters like wraiths
	and vampires, as well as zaps from wands of draining.

	Can not be eaten for permanent drain resistance.
amulet of esp
	An amulet of ESP grants extrinsic telepathy when worn, which will
	show all monsters with minds within a 10x10 grid, and all such
	monsters on the level when blind.

	If you polymorph into a metallivore and eat the amulet, it will
	instead grant intrinsic telepathy. This takes effect only when you
	are blind, and shows all monsters with minds on the whole level.

	ESP is an abbreviation for Extra-Sensory Perception; that is,
	perception not gained through the five traditionally-attested
	senses: hearing, feeling, sight, taste and smell.
amulet of life saving
	The amulet of life saving is a valuable amulet in NetHack. If you
	are wearing one and you die, the amulet literally saves your life
	and restores you to full hit points. It cannot be eaten for
	intrinsics.

	If you die while wearing the amulet, it will save your life. The
	amulet disintegrates and becomes identified, and the following
	things (mostly good) happen to you:[

	- You lose 1 constitution point.
	- Your hit point maximum is increased to either 10 or twice your
	  experience level, whichever is higher, if it is less than this.
	- Your hit points are restored to the maximum.
	- Your nutrition is restored to 500, if it is less than this.
	- If you died from choking over your food, your nutrition becomes 900.
	- If you are sick and going to die immediately, you become cured.
	- If you are trapped in lava, you become untrapped.

	Amulets of life saving do not work if cursed or worn by a non-
	living creature. This applies to monsters as well as the player.
amulet of strangulation
	Wearing an amulet of strangulation quickly strangles you to death,
	unless you are headless or both breathless and mindless, in six
	turns. Removing it nullifies the effect; however, most of these
	amulets are generated cursed.

	Eating this amulet has a 19 in 20 chance of choking you to death
	immediately, unless you are breathless. If you do manage to get
	the amulet off, your strength is still abused.
amulet of nausea
	Causes the wearer to become sick and vomit occasionally.
	Usually cursed.
amulet of restful sleep
	While wearing the amulet, or randomly after having eaten one, you
	will consistently fall asleep within the next 100 turns. After
	falling asleep, you awaken within 1 to 20 turns or when disturbed.
	The cycle continues as long as you have the restful sleep
	property. Sleep resistance will not cure the condition, but
	prevents you from actually falling asleep.
amulet versus poison
	An amulet versus poison grants poison resistance as an extrinsic.
amulet of danger
	Provides infravision and greatly increases dungeon difficulty.
	Usually cursed.
amulet versus stone
	Provides extrinsic petrification resistance.
amulet of change
	Putting on an amulet of change of any beatitude will change the
	gender of the wearer, Auto-identifying the amulet - the amulet
	always disintegrates afterward. If you are polymorphed into a
	single-sex monster, your base gender will be altered, but not
	your current one. There is a small exception to this regarding
	foocubi - i.e., a player shapeshifted into an incubus will change
	into a succubus and vice versa.

	Putting on this amulet does not break polyselfless conduct.
	Eating the amulet will have a 1 in 5 chance of changing your gender.
amulet of unchanging
	The amulet prevents polymorphing and other means of changing form,
	and also protects the wearer from sliming; if you put one on while
	suffering from sliming, it is aborted. It does not prevent being
	turned to stone. If you eat the amulet, you are "un-changed" and
	revert to your normal form.

	In most cases, if you die while polymorphed and wearing an amulet
	of unchanging, you will not revert to your normal form, and will
	instead die. However, if you are polymorphed into a wood or
	leather golem and get rotted away by a brown pudding, or else
	polymorphed into an iron golem and rusted, you will resume your
	normal form. If you are polymorphed and decline to die in explore
	or wizard mode, you will also resume your normal form.

	A lawful player who prays while in undead form will return to
	their normal form, even while wearing the amulet.
amulet of reflection
	When worn, the amulet conveys extrinsic reflection - reflecting a
	ray or passive gaze while wearing the amulet without any other
	source of reflection will auto-identify it. Some monsters can
	also wear this amulet, and it is the only other amulet they will
	actively wear besides an amulet of life saving.

	This amulet no longer fully protects you from the effects of rays
	while reflecting them, but still significantly reduces their impact.

	Eating an amulet of reflection will have no effect.
amulet of magical breathing
	Grants extrinsic breathlessness to its wearer. Allows you to
	travel underwater safely, although your items will still become
	wet. You cannot choke over your food, and you are immune to the
	effects of poison clouds from a green dragon's breath, scroll of
	stinking cloud, or the lava on the Plane of Fire.

	Wearing this amulet protects from drowning attacks. Relatedly,
	you won't get the bonus 1000 experience points for killing sea
	monsters with this attack while wearing it.

	Less helpfully, when you are unbreathing, water is considered a
	safe teleport location. This means that while wearing this amulet,
	uncontrolled teleportation can land you in water, making all your
	stuff wet.
amulet of magic resistance
	Grants magic resistance while worn, and its default material is
	iron, like all amulets.
amulet of guarding
	Wearing an amulet of guarding provides 2 AC and augments magic
	cancellation by 2, similar to a ring of protection. Eating an
	amulet of guarding has a chance to increase intrinsic protection
	by 2, but does not affect magic cancellation.

	Monsters can wear an amulet of guarding.
amulet of flying
	Grants the flying intrinsic, which is similar to levitation but
	far more useful. Flight is a property possessed by some monsters,
	which is superficially similar to levitation but has generally more
	controlled effects, covered on the page about flying. Of its
	effects, the only one which is negative is being unable to reach
	items in pits. This is of course easily solved by taking off the
	amulet on the rare occasions that a valuable item falls into one.
	Note however that you can descend into holes with the > command
	("You jump through the trap door."). You don't need to remove it then.

	Flight is superior to levitation in almost all manners. Basically,
	it allows the player to not need to worry about terrain much at
	all, since it allows one to usefully cross and interact with any
	sort of terrain. In addition, the amulet cannot be destroyed by
	an electric eel or removed by an incubus, making flight over water
	considerably safer than levitation over water with a ring.
amphisbaena
	A snake with a head on either end, as opposed to a head and a

amethyst*
	The twelfth foundation is amethyst. Isidorus says of it: Among
	purple stones, the Indian amethyst holds first position; it is,
	indeed, purple but of mixed coloration, giving forth violet and
	rose-coloured lights; it is easy to engrave. For this reason the
	humility of the saints is signified by it;
	  	[ The Aberdeen Bestiary, translated by Colin McLaren ]
angel
	He answered and said unto them, he that soweth the good seed
	is the Son of man; the field is the world, and the good seed
	are the children of the kingdom; but the weeds are the
	children of the wicked one; the enemy that sowed them is the
	devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers
	are the angels.  As therefore the weeds are gathered and
	burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
	[...]  So shall it be at the end of the world; the angels
	shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
	and shall cast them into the furnace of fire; there shall be
	wailing and gnashing of teeth.

anhur
	An Egyptian god of war and a great hunter, few gods can match
	his fury.  Unlike many gods of war, he is a force for good.
	The wrath of Anhur is slow to come, but it is inescapable
	once earned.  Anhur is a mighty figure with four arms.  He
	is often seen with a powerful lance that requires both of
	his right arms to wield and which is tipped with a fragment
	of the sun.  He is married to Mehut, a lion-headed goddess.
ankh-morpork
	The twin city of Ankh-Morpork, foremost of all the cities
	bounding the Circle Sea, was as a matter of course the home
	of a large number of gangs, thieves' guilds, syndicates and
	similar organisations.  This was one of the reasons for its
	wealth.  Most of the humbler folk on the widdershin side of
	the river, in Morpork's mazy alleys, supplemented their
	meagre incomes by filling some small role for one or other
	of the competing gangs.

aphrodite
	I will sing of stately Aphrodite, gold-crowned and beautiful,
	whose dominion is the walled cities of all sea-set Cyprus.
	There the moist breath of the western wind wafted her over
	the waves of the loud moaning sea in soft foam, and there
	the gold-filleted Hours welcomed her joyously.  They clothed
	her with heavenly garments: on her head they put a fine,
	well-wrought crown of gold, and in her pierced ears they
	hung ornaments of orichalc and precious gold, and adorned
	her with golden necklaces over her soft neck and snow-white
	breasts, jewels which the gold-filleted Hours wear themselves
	whenever they go to their father's house to join the lovely
	dances of the gods.  And when they had fully decked her, they
	brought her to the gods, who welcomed her when they saw her,
	giving her their hands.  Each one of them prayed that he might
	lead her home to be his wedded wife, so greatly were they
	amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned Cytherea.

athol
	In 1927, zoologist Ernst Bartels was in his home near the
	Tjidjenkol River in Java when he heard a strange cry louder than
	the other night sounds, a cry like "a-hool."
	Bartels heard the sound twice more before the origin of the cries
	moved off into the night. Bartels soon remembered a local legend
	of the ahool or athol, a type of huge bat reputed to live in
	the area.

	Locals described the bat as the size of a small child, with
	an 11-12 foot wingspan. The athol was supposedly covered in
	grayish fur and had a face similar to that of a monkey or a man.
	At times, it was seen sitting on the forest floor, with its wings
	folded beside it; it was also reputed to have feet which pointed
	backwards. During the day (like all bats, it was nocturnal), the
	athol's refuge was supposedly a cave somewhere near a waterfall,
	although at night it would fly over the river's surface in
	search of fish.

	and is derived from the Persian _Aeshma_.  In _Tobit_ Asmodeus
	falls in love with Sara, daughter of Raguel, and causes the
	death of seven husbands in succession, each on his bridal night.
	He was finally driven from Egypt through a charm made by Tobias
	of the heart and liver of a fish burned on perfumed ashes, as
	described by Milton in _Paradise Lost_ (IV, 167-71).  Hence
	Asmodeus often figures as the spirit of matrimonial jealousy
	or unhappiness.

bag of holding
    Placing items into a noncursed bag of holding reduces their weight,
    making it one of the most coveted objects for general use.
    Generally speaking: bags of holding halve the weight of its
    contents, blessed bags divide it by four, and cursed bags double
    it.

    Tipping or looking into a cursed bag of holding may make items
    vanish, with a separate 1/13 chance for each item.

    Some items should not be put in a bag of holding, or they will
    make the bag explode - scattering all of its contents, destroying
    the bag and damaging the player. These items are as follows:

    - Other bags of holding
    - Bags of tricks with charges remaining
    - Wands of cancellation with charges remaining
    - MagicBane
    - Other bags containing any of the above items

    These have a chance of not exploding if you nest them.
bag of rats
    The bag of rats is very similar to a bag of tricks, but when
    applied it will only create random rats. If #tipped, it will
    expend every charge at once.

    If #looted, there is a chance of being bitten by a rat for 2d4
    damage, otherwise the bag is identified.

    When a bag of rats has no charges left, it acts as a normal sack.

    Unlike a bag of tricks, a charged bag of rats is not a threat to
    store in a bag of holding - there is no risk of a magical explosion.
bag of tricks
    Bags of tricks are generated uncursed, with 3 to 20 charges.
    Attempting to #loot a bag of tricks will cause it to bite you
    for d10 damage, which auto-identifies it.

    Applying a charged bag of tricks will use up one charge and
    cause a random effect; the bag also is auto-identified.
    Chance	Effect
    31/40	Creates a monster.
    2/40	Spits out a random item.
    1/40	Bag "wriggles away from you", causing it to drop.
    1/40	Tries to pull you in, paralyzing for d4 turns.
    1/40	Spits out a stinking cloud.
    1/40	Causes hallucination for 10+d35 turns.
    1/40	Yells "Boo!", scaring nearby monsters and possibly the player.
    1/40	Grows teeth and bites, as if looted.
    1/40	Licks your wielded weapon from your hand, causing it to drop.

    The created item will be an iron chain if the bag is cursed or has
    been recharged. Otherwise, the game will make three attempts to
    create an item that weighs less than 100 aum and is small enough
    to fit in a container. If all three attempts generate invalid
    items, the bag "coughs nervously" and produces nothing.

    A bag of tricks with no charges can hold items like a regular sack;
    charging it again will destroy any items inside. Since the bag of
    tricks is a "magical bag", it will also protect its fragile
    contents from shattering like a bag of holding; this also means
    that a cursed bag of tricks with no charges is subject to item loss
    like a cursed bag of holding.

    Using #tip with a bag of tricks will attempt to expend all the
    charges. If a monster is created, it will use up another charge.
    If a non-monster effect is encountered the tipping process is
    arrested.

    placing a bag of tricks with charges into a bag of holding
    will cause a magical explosion.

    The sack is the most basic form of container in NetHack. A sack
    stores items beyond the 52-character limit, and protects its
    contents from fire, cold, and many other forms of damage; it is
    also among the lightest of the containers in the game. However,
    throwing a sack may break or damage some of its contents; if a
    sack gets wet (e.g. from falling into a pool), it contents may
    become wet as well.

barding
spiked barding
barding of reflection
	Barding is armor for steeds. Throughout history, barding came in
	several shapes and sizes. In this setting, imagine barding
	protecting your steed's head/neck and flank all the way back to
	the start of where the saddle would be. It is applied to your
	steed just as you apply a saddle, and just like saddles, it's 'one
	size fits all'. The material the barding is made from determines
	how much extra AC protection it gives your steed (iron, the softer
	/more dense metals - 3 AC, steel or stone - 4 AC, mithril - 5 AC).

	It also affords some protection to your steeds head against any
	attacks that target it (zombie bite attack, mind flayer tentacle
	attack, etc). Barding can be enchanted just like any other piece
	of armor, and follows the same rules/behavior. To enchant barding,
	the player must have their steed wear it, and be mounted on their
	steed. When reading a scroll of enchant armor, they'll be given
	the option to enchant the barding.

	Spiked barding: Just like regular barding, but is covered with tiny
	sharp spikes that protrude outward. If your steed is engulfed
	while it's wearing spiked barding, the monster engulfing it will
	spit it back out.

	Barding of reflection: Just like regular barding, but it's fully
	reflective just like a shield of reflection.

	Barding (also spelled bard or barb) is body armour for war horses.
	The practice of armoring horses was first extensively developed in
	antiquity in the eastern kingdoms of Parthia and Pahlava, and
	after the conquests of Alexander the Great it made its way into
	European military practices via the Seleucid Empire and later
	Byzantine Empire.  Though its historical roots lie in antiquity in
	the regions of what was once the Persian Empire, barded horses have
	become a symbol of the late European Middle Ages chivalry and the
	era of knights.

bear*trap
	A beartrap is a tool object that can be used to create a bear trap
	on the ground. This is a trap that will clamp onto any monster or
	adventurer unlucky enough to stumble onto it, dealing 2d4 damage.

	The beartrap item is usually obtained by untrapping a live bear
	trap. These can be applied on the ground to create a trap to clamp
	onto monsters unlucky enough to not avoid the trap, rendering them
	immobile until they escape. Monsters that are too small, amorphous,
	whirly, unsolid or flying won't be trapped, and metallivores can
	eat the trap. Be careful, as you can still get caught in your own
	bear trap if you step on it or fail to disarm it.

	You will escape a bear trap under the following circumstances:

	- If you are levitating or flying, you will avoid the trap. If the
	  trap is hidden, it will not be revealed.
	- If you are polymorphed into a form that is amorphous, whirly or
	  unsolid, you will avoid the trap.
	- If you are polymorphed into a form that is tiny or small, and
	  you are not riding a steed, you will avoid the trap.
	- If none of these apply, you have a 4/5 chance of avoiding the
	  bear trap if you are already aware of it and are not fumbling.
	  Otherwise, you are caught.

	Being caught in a bear trap renders you unable to move, in addition
	to the damage it deals. When caught in a bear trap, you are unable
	to kick. During this time, you still can attack and be attacked.

	If you trigger the trap when riding, it affects your steed instead
	of you. Monsters can be trapped too.

	Escaping
	The ordinary way to escape a bear trap is to try to move out of it.
	For some reason, trying to move diagonally is most effective,
	allowing you to escape in 4-7 moves; this will move you
	diagonally out of the trap even if a wall is in the way. Attempting
	to move orthogonally requires about five times as many moves to
	escape.

	Another way to escape from a bear trap is to use teleport, level
	teleport, or branchport to move yourself away from it. You can also
	polymorph yourself into a form that cannot be held by a bear trap,
	due to size or body composition.

	Zapping a wand of opening or casting knock downward will instantly
	release you.

	Finally, it is possible to jump out of a bear trap. This carries a
	penalty, however: you will take d10 damage and suffer wounded legs
	for 500-1499 turns.

	Oddly, beartraps reset themselves after someone escapes from them.

	Disarming
	Once you know the location of a bear trap, you can attempt to
	#untrap it. You cannot disarm a bear trap that is holding you, so
	you must escape the trap first. When you attempt to disarm the
	trap, there is a chance that you will be accidentally caught in it
	instead. If you successfully disarm the trap, it will be replaced
	by a beartrap item on the ground.

	It is also possible to remove a bear trap by eating it, if you are
	polymorphed into a metallivore. Unlike untrapping, you can eat a
	bear trap that is holding you, and there is no chance of
	accidentally triggering the trap. However, eating the trap will
	obviously not produce a beartrap item.

	Probably most commonly associated with trapping, the leghold
	trap is a rather simple mechanical trap.  It is made up of two
	jaws, a spring of some sort, and a trigger in the middle.  When
	the animal steps on the trigger the trap closes around the leg,
	holding the animal in place.  Usually some kind of lure is used
	to position the animal, or the trap is set on an animal trail.
	Traditionally, leghold traps had tightly closing "teeth" to make
	sure the animal stayed in place.  The teeth also made sure the
	animal could not move the leg in the trap and ruin their fur.
	However, this resulted in many animals gnawing off legs in order
	to escape.  More modern traps have a gap called an "offset jaw"
	and work more like a handcuff.  They grip above the paw, making
	sure the animal cannot pull out but does not destroy the leg.
	This also allows the trapper to release unwanted catches.

~bell of opening
*bell
	A bell is a musical instrument. It does not play notes; its function
	is to ring. Bells are often found on graves reading "Saved by the
	bell!" All bells are generated uncursed.

	Unlike horns, harps, and flutes, there are no randomly-generated
	magical bells. The only magical bell in the game is the Bell of
	Opening, which has the distinct appearance of "silver bell".

	Ringing a blessed or uncursed bell makes noise (waking nearby
	monsters) and calls pets. A cursed bell, however, has a 1/4 chance
	of summoning a nymph (she won't be carrying any items), assuming
	none of the nymphs are genocided or extinct. If a nymph is summoned,
	the bell has a 7% chance of breaking (the Bell of Opening never
	breaks). If the bell doesn't break, then with equal probability:
	- there may be no effect;
	- the summoned nymph may be fast; or
	- the player may be paralyzed for 2 turns.
	No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece

blindfold
	A blindfold is a tool that can be used to achieve blindness.
	After gaining intrinsic telepathy by eating a floating eye corpse,
	applying a blindfold is good for detecting monsters. (Note:
	Intrinsic telepathy from floating eyes is now temporary.)

	A blindfold is also useful if you are about to encounter a monster
	that can do you harm with its gaze (floating eye, pyrolisk, Medusa)
	or that can blind you (yellow light).

	The blindfolding was performed by binding a piece of the
	yellowish linen whereof those of the Amahagger who condescended
	to wear anything in particular made their dresses tightly round
	the eyes.  This linen I afterwards discovered was taken from the
	tombs, and was not, as I had first supposed, of native
	manufacture.  The bandage was then knotted at the back of the
	head, and finally brought down again and the ends bound under
	the chin to prevent its slipping.  Ustane was, by the way, also

~spirit bomb
*bomb
    Bombs are a new type of weapon in HackEM. There are three specific
    types, the fire bomb, the gas bomb, and the sonic bomb. All are
    found on soldiers of various ranks.

    Frag bombs do 3d6 fire damage that can degrade organic armor and
    destroy scrolls and potions, while gas bombs do 3d6 poison damage
    to any monsters that are not poison resistant. The explosion of a
    bomb on its own will create a blast radius, a 3 x 3 square (the
    same form as a fireball) centered on the bomb's landing point.
    Multiple bombs exploding on the same square may produce a larger
    blast radius. Also note that exploding bombs will destroy bullets
    lying on the ground. If an armed bomb explodes in your inventory,
    you'll take damage despite any resistances you may have.

    Bombs will become armed when they are thrown or applied. Note that
    applying a stack of bombs in your inventory will only arm a single
    bomb. A bomb will explode 1-6 turns after having being armed,
    depending on its BUC status:

    Blessed: 4 turns
    Uncursed: d2+2 turns
    Cursed: d5+1 turns

    Cursed bombs additionally have a chance of not arming at all. The
    first turn in the above counts includes the turn taken arming the
    bomb. Note that the better the BUC status of the bomb, the more
    reliable its fuse length. Armed bombs can be kicked or picked up
    and thrown at other targets. Bombs will explode on impact. The
    impact of a bomb always does 1-2 points of damage before the
    explosion.

#	"It's a boomerang," said Vimes.  "You find something like this
#	all over the world.  You have to wave it carefully and suddenly
#	your opponent gets it in the back.  I've heard that there's a lad
#	in Fourecks who can throw a boomerang with such precision that it

#		[ Raising Steam, by Terry Pratchett ]

    When used as a melee weapon rather than thrown, a boomerang has a
    luck-dependent chance of breaking into splinters.

	Rincewind pulled himself up and thought about reaching for his
	stick.  And then he thought again.  The man had a couple of spears
	stuck in the ground, and people here were good at spears, because
	if you didn't get efficient at hitting the things that moved fast
	you had to eat the things that moved slowly.  He was also holding
	a boomerang, and it wasn't one of those toy ones that came back.
	This was one of the big, heavy, gently curved sort that didn't
	come back because it was sticking in something's ribcage.  You
	could laugh at the idea of wooden weapons until you saw the kind
	of wood that grew here.

boulder
	I worked the lever well under, and stretched my back; the end
	of the stone rose up, and I kicked the fulcrum under.  Then,
	when I was going to bear down, I remembered there was
	something to get out from below; when I let go of the lever,
	the stone would fall again.  I sat down to think, on the root
	of the oak tree; and, seeing it stand about the ground, I saw
	my way.  It was lucky I had brought a longer lever.  It would
	just reach to wedge under the oak root.
	Bearing it down so far would have been easy for a heavy man,
	but was a hard fight for me.  But this time I meant to do it
	if it killed me, because I knew it could be done.  Twice I
	got it nearly there, and twice the weight bore it up again;
	but when I flung myself on it the third time, I heard in my
	ears the sea-sound of Poseidon.  Then I knew this time I
	would do it; and so I did.

	Bugbears are relatives of goblins, although they tend to be

bugle
	The bugle is a tonal musical instrument, and the only non-magical
	instrument that lacks a magical  equivalent.

	Sergeants, lieutenants, and captains in the Yendorian Army have a
	1/3 chance of being generated with a bugle.

	Applying a bugle will allow you to play it. Improvising can awaken
	or scare nearby monsters, as with a tooled horn - however, it will
	also awaken, anger, and unparalyze all soldiers and watchmen on
	the level. Improvising abuses your wisdom.

	Soldiers themselves are capable of using bugles to the same effect
	- a soldier will only play it if there is another sleeping soldier
	in a 7×7 square around them.

	Note: Bugles now work against fewer monsters, and some are
	completely immune. Priests and Angels are no longer scared by
	bugles.

	collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably

	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and

crystal chest
    A rare and magical type of container that cannot be locked,
    unlocked or forced open by any physical means (this includes the
    Master Key of Thievery). The only way to open or lock this

    'knock' to unlock, or a wand of locking or the spell 'wizard lock'
    to secure. Otherwise, a crystal chest is immune to all other
    forms of magic, meaning it cannot be probed, cancelled, or
    polymorphed. This makes it the ideal container for the player to
    use to stash useful gear, as intelligent monsters will unlock and
    loot regular containers if given the chance, nor do monsters
    currently know how to use locking/unlocking magic. Crystal chests

cobra
	Darzee and his wife only cowered down in the nest without
	answering, for from the thick grass at the foot of the bush
	there came a low hiss -- a horrid cold sound that made
	Rikki-tikki jump back two clear feet.  Then inch by inch out of
	the grass rose up the head and spread hood of Nag, the big
	black cobra, and he was five feet long from tongue to tail.
	When he had lifted one-third of himself clear of the ground,
	he stayed balancing to and fro exactly as a dandelion-tuft
	balances in the wind, and he looked at Rikki-tikki with the
	wicked snake's eyes that never change their expression,
	whatever the snake may be thinking of.
	'Who is Nag?' said he.  '_I_ am Nag.  The great God Brahm put
	his mark upon all our people, when the first cobra spread his
	hood to keep the sun off Brahm as he slept.  Look, and be
	afraid!'

basilisk
cockatrice
	Once in a great while, when the positions of the stars are
	just right, a seven-year-old rooster will lay an egg.  Then,
	along will come a snake, to coil around the egg, or a toad,
	to squat upon the egg, keeping it warm and helping it to
	hatch.  When it hatches, out comes a creature called basilisk,
	or cockatrice, the most deadly of all creatures.  A single
	glance from its yellow, piercing toad's eyes will kill both
	man and beast.  Its power of destruction is said to be so
	great that sometimes simply to hear its hiss can prove fatal.
	Its breath is so venomous that it causes all vegetation
	to wither.

	There is, however, one creature which can withstand the
	basilisk's deadly gaze, and this is the weasel.  No one knows
	why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay the
	basilisk, it will itself be killed in the struggle.  Perhaps
	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
	sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.
	But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for it is said that
	merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to
	sicken and die.

	Keystone Kops frequently generate with cream pies.

	Throwing a cream pie at a monster will blind them; monsters can

	Wielding a cream pie and attacking with it will splatter the pie
	in the target monster's face.

	Attacking with thrown and/or wielded cream pies do no damage, and
	thus does not break pacifist conduct.

	If you are hit by a cream pie, you can #wipe your face or apply a
	towel to regain sight faster; applying a cursed towel may cause

crystal ball
	A randomly generated crystal ball is normally generated with 1-5
	charges and has a 25% chance of being blessed, a 50% chance of
	being uncursed, and a 25% chance of being cursed.

	Elvenkings have a 2% chance of being generated with a crystal ball.
	Applying or #invoking a charged crystal ball while not blind will
	initiate an Intelligence check - if the result of a d20 is less
	than or equal to your Intelligence, the check succeeds and can
	then search for a symbol on the current level, consuming a charge.
	A cursed crystal ball will always fail the check when used, and a
	failed check will produce on of the following effects:

	No further effect.
	You are confused for d100 turns.
	You are blinded for d100 turns.
	You hallucinate for d100 turns.
	The ball explodes, destroying it and dealing d30 damage. This is
	affected by half physical damage, and artifact crystal balls will
	not break this way.

	Applying a crystal ball will always put you into a helpless trance
	for 1 to 10 turns - a ring of free action will not prevent this.
	Applying a crystal ball with no charges will always reveal nothing,
	but does not risk negative effects.

	On a successful check, you can specify any symbol representing a
	monster, object or trap. If you try to search for anything else,
	such as stairs or other dungeon features, you will instead receive
	a random message hinting at the location of a special level: Delphi,
	Medusa's lair, the Castle, or the Tower of the Wizard of Yendor.
	The message you receive depends on whether you are in the same
	dungeon branch as the target level and its dungeon level relative
	to yours: "You see <foo>, <where>." The exact message and location
	<where> is determined based on the information in the following
	table:

	You look into one of these and see _vapours swirling like
	clouds_.  These shortly clear away to show a sort of video

dilithium*

	make reference to the mining of dilithium deposits. ...
	This name itself is imaginary and gives no real information on
	the structure or make-up of this substance other than that this
	version of the name implies a lithium and iron-bearing
	aluminosilicate of some sort.  That said, the real mineral that
	most closely matches the descriptive elements of this name is

	In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although
	preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it
	was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction
	and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous
	undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend
	not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire
	breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail,
	the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.
		[ Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]

	"One whom the dragons will speak with," he said, "that is a
	dragonlord, or at least that is the center of the matter.  It's
	not a trick of mastering the dragons, as most people think.
	Dragons have no masters.  The question is always the same, with
	a dragon:  will he talk to you or will he eat you?  If you can
	count upon his doing the former, and not doing the latter, why
	then you're a dragonlord."
		[ The Tombs of Atuan, by Ursula K. Le Guin ]

	Dragons occasionally roar at the player. This can inflict the
	afraid status effect, making the player flee from the dragon.
    If you can see or hear the dragon, it will frighten you, so
    you'll need to be both blind and deaf in order to prevent this
    effect.
    Drinking liquid courage dispels the Afraid condition. While
    confused, you'll be immune to further strikes of fear.

    There are a few ways to prevent the afraid status:
    - Be a knight. Knights have been trained to tame their fear.
    - Wear Pridwen, the shield of King Arthur.
    - Wear Dragonbane.
    - Have a source of psychic resistance.

dragon scales
*dtsund*
    Dragon scales and dtsund dragon-scaled armor

    dtsund dragon-scaled armor is named after the person who originally
	came up with the idea for removing dragon scale mail, and having
	dragon scales fuse with existing worn body armor instead. This
	system of dragon-scaled armor was first introduced in NetHack
	Fourk, then xNetHack, and then EvilHack. This system of dragon
	scales is in effect in Hack'EM, using EvilHack's implementation.

	- Dragon scales are now worn in the cloak slot, providing their
	  dragon's primary extrinsic, AC 3, and MC 0.

	- Reading enchant armor while wearing body armor under scales
	  hardens the scales and fuses them together, causing that armor
	  to gain +5 AC and confer the matching primary extrinsic.
	- Secondary extrinsics are not realized by wearing dragon scales
	  on their own. They must be crafted into dragon-scaled armor for
	  the secondary characteristics to function.

	- The armor is not made erodeproof, but if the scroll was blessed,
	  its erosion is repaired and it becomes blessed.
	- If the scroll was cursed, the armor still fuses together, but
	  becomes cursed and loses a point of enchantment. Otherwise, the
	  armor's enchantment does not change, and any enchantment on the
	  scales is discarded.

	- If you are confused, the scales meld into the armor and then the
	  armor melds into you, polymorphing you into the corresponding
	  dragon.
	- Reading enchant armor with scales but without body armor will
	  polymorph you into the corresponding dragon. Wearing a shirt
	  doesn't affect this.
	- If you have polymorph control, you can decline to become a dragon.

	A blessed scroll gives you additional time as a dragon and a cursed
	  scroll gives you less time.
	- Scaled armor is never destroyed or separated into its components
	  when you become a dragon; it reverts back to your body armor when
	  you revert.

	- You can change the color of the scales on body armor by wearing
	  a new set of scales and reading enchant armor. The old scale
	  color goes away.

	- There are no limitations on what body armor can be used.

	- "<Foo> dragon scale mail" no longer exists as an object, so it
	  can't be wished for. If the player wishes for '<foo> dragon scale
	  mail', they'll receive 'a set of <foo> dragon scales' instead.

	- Dragon-scaled body armor cannot be wished for. It must be crafted.

	- Player monsters that used to receive dragon scale mail now
	  receive a standard random suit, dragon-scaled with a random color
	  of dragon scales.

	- Shopkeepers charge a much higher price for a dragon-scaled piece
	  of armor than they would for the same armor piece without scales.

	- Dragon scales having secondary extrinsics was taken from
	  SporkHack, and then heavily modified - all dragon scales have a
	  secondary extrinsic effect when fused with regular body armor and
	  turned into dragon-scaled armor. Dragon scales worn on their own
	  only exhibit their primary extrinsic, with one exception - gold
	  dragon/chromatic dragon scales will give off light, regardless
	  of whether it's just scales or dragon-scaled armor.


	Stephen had argued, and the expert armorer had grudgingly
	admitted, that dragonscale shield or armor, provided it proved
	feasible to make at all, ought to offer some real, practical
	advantages over any metal breastplate or shield -- gram for
	gram of weight, such a defense would probably be a lot
	tougher and more protective than any human smiths could
	make of steel.

*drum
~drum of earthquake
	A leather drum is an atonal musical instrument, so it cannot be
	used to play the passtune. It is one of the two drums.

	Applying a leather drum (or a depleted drum of earthquake) will
	"beat a deafening row!"; this will awaken and scare nearby monsters
	- including pets - and abuse your wisdom. You will also become deaf
	for 30-49 (more) turns. Monsters are awakened if their distance to
	you is at most 6.3 * sqrt(XL), and are scared (if not resisted) if
	their distance to you is at most 3.65 * sqrt(XL), where XL is your
	experience level, with the usual check against monster magic
	resistance against the scare effect.

	Many travelers have seen the drums of the great apes, and
	some have heard the sounds of their beating and the noise of
	the wild, weird revelry of these first lords of the jungle,
	but Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, is, doubtless, the only human
	being who ever joined in the fierce, mad, intoxicating revel
	of the Dum-Dum.
		[ Tarzan of the Apes, by Edgar Rice Burroughs ]
drum of earthquake
	The drum of earthquake is a magical drum and is generated with
	4-8 charges.

	Applying a charged drum of earthquake will will "produce a heavy,
	thunderous rolling!" This will create several pits around and
	possibly under you; it will wake up all monsters on the level,
	unfreezing them as well. Monsters hidden on the ceiling will be
	shaken off.

	Monsters within 23.7 Euclidean distance will flee if they don't
	resist, and peaceful monsters within a 4*((u.ulevel - 1) / 3 + 1)+1
	wide square centered on you will become hostile. The Wizard of
	Yendor and other "meditating" monsters will only be awakened in
	that square area.

	A drum with no charges behaves like a leather drum, except that it
	doesn't cause deafness.

	The power of this item increases massively as you level up; at
	XL 30 it will create large fields of pits, as opposed to just a few
	around you.

	The pits created by a drum of earthquake can destroy altars similar
	to applying a wand of digging, and works even on undiggable dungeon
	levels. The high altars in Moloch's Sanctum and the Astral Plane
	will be unaffected.
dunce*
    When worn, the dunce cap sets your intelligence and wisdom to 6
    each and autocurses, even if originally blessed; this will auto-
    identify the dunce cap. Dunce caps also prevent any change to
    your intelligence or wisdom while worn, akin to a ring of sustain
    ability. Removing the cap will restore your intelligence and
    wisdom to their original values.

    Shopping while wearing a dunce cap will cause the shopkeeper to
    add an additional 1/3 markup to the price of each item when buying,
    and only give you 1/3 of the base price when selling items. This
    is also the penalty for being a low-level Tourist or having a
    visible shirt; these penalties are not cumulative.

	A dunce cap, also variously known as a dunce hat, dunce's
	cap, or dunce's hat, is a tall conical hat.  In popular
	culture, it is typically made of paper and often marked with
	a D, and given to schoolchildren to wear as punishment for
	being stupid or lazy.  While this is now a rare practice,
	it is frequently depicted in popular culture such as
	children's cartoons.

	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery

	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in
	the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

	great lands and the isles, and took to the moonlight and the
	starlight, and to the woods and the caves, becoming as shadows
	and memories, save those who ever and anon set sail into the West
	and vanished from Middle-earth.  But in the dawn of years Elves
	and Men were allies and held themselves akin, and there were some
	among Men that learned the wisdom of the Eldar, and became great
	and valiant among the captains of the Noldor.  And in the glory
	and beauty of the Elves, and in their fate, full share had the
	offspring of elf and mortal, Earendil, and Elwing, and Elrond
	their child.

eel
giant eel
	The behaviour of eels in fresh water extends the air of
	mystery surrounding them.  They move freely into muddy, silty
	bottoms of lakes, lying buried in the daylight hours in summer.
	[...]  Eels are voracious carnivores, feeding mainly at
	night and consuming a wide variety of fishes and invertebrate
	creatures.  Contrary to earlier thinking, eels seek living
	rather than dead creatures and are not habitual eaters of
	carrion.

eight ball
	(a)pply an eight ball to shake it.

	(r)ead an eight ball to get a fortune for a yes/no question.

	Eight balls are not generated randomly; currently they only rarely
	drop from plastic golems.

	Reply hazy, try again.
egg
	An egg is a comestible which may also hatch into a monster if
	left uneaten. If an egg hatches, the hatched monster may become
	your pet. One in three generated eggs is from a non-unique,
	non-aquatic and oviparous species, picked according to the normal
	random monster generation for the current level. The species of
	monster eggs can be identified by any magical method; monster eggs
	can also be identified by seeing one hatch. If the post-
	identification type is still just "egg", it is not a monster egg
	(presumably just an ordinary unfertilized hen egg); if it is a
	monster egg, you will be able to recognize the type in the future.

	Polymorphing into the adult form of an oviparous monster
	(regardless of gender) will also identify all future eggs of that
	type; polymorphing into any type of adult dragon will identify
	all types of dragon eggs as well.

	Winged gargoyles are oviparous, but lay very few winged gargoyle
	eggs; 76/77 (approx. 98.7%) of the time, the egg will hatch into
	a normal gargoyle.

	Eggs don't provide any intrinsics that the corresponding corpse
	would provide. An egg becomes stale after 400 turns; the spell or
	wand of undead turning can rejuvenate stale eggs. A stale egg
	makes you nauseated for 10d4 (more) turns, eventually causing you
	to vomit unless cured.

	If the egg is a cockatrice egg, you will suffer delayed
	petrification unless resistant. Unless you identified the egg,
	you will not know whether it's a cockatrice egg until you eat it.
	Pets which aren't petrification-resistant will avoid eating
	cockatrice eggs, which is one way to informally identify them.

	If you polymorph into a female oviparous monster, you can lay an
	egg with the #sit command, and when it hatches it will become your
	pet. Laying an egg will reduce your nutrition by 80. Breaking your
	own eggs carries a -1 Luck penalty each, to a maximum of -5 for a
	single stack; eating them does not, but grants no net nutrition gain.
	A randomly generated dragon egg will also become your pet if you
	are carrying it when it hatches. If you are male, there is a 50%
	chance that any egg which hatches while you are carrying it will
	become your pet.

	A fresh monster egg will hatch with about 99.954% chance, unless
	the relevant monster (either baby or adult form) is genocided. If
	an egg will hatch, it will do so after 151-200 turns.

	Eggs will only hatch if in your inventory or on the floor; if kept
	in a container on the turn it's supposed to hatch, the egg will
	turn infertile. Zapping an egg with a spell or wand of undead
	turning will re-fertilize it and reset the hatch timeout.
	Strangely enough, re-fertilizing eggs will not affect their age
	(so they may still be stale or rotten).

	Eggs kept in an ice box will not age and become rotten; however,
	this does not suspend their hatching timer, so leaving an egg in
	an ice box for too long will prevent it from ever hatching.

	But I asked why not keep it and let the hen sit on it till it
	hatched, and then we could see what would come out of it.
	"Nothing good, I'm certain of that," Mom said.  "It would
	probably be something horrible.  But just remember, if it's a
	crocodile or a dragon or something like that, I won't have it
	in my house for one minute."

	"This is poor fare," they said to the hobbits; "for we are

	our guests at home, we will treat you better."
	"It seems to me good enough for a birthday-party," said Frodo.

A.S*
	Presently we reached a place where the beach narrowed; the sea
	almost came up to the foot of the cliffs, leaving a passage no
	wider than a couple of yards.  Between two projecting rocks we
	caught sight of the entrance to a dark tunnel.
	There, on a slab of granite, appeared two mysterious letters,
	half eaten away by time -- the two initials of the bold,
	adventurous traveller:

			A.S.

	'A.S.,' cried my uncle. 'Arne Saknussemm! Arne Saknussemm again!'

	[...] at the sight of those two letters, carved there three

excalibur
	At first only its tip was visible, but then it rose, straight,
	proud, all that was noble and great and wondrous.  The tip of
	the blade pointed toward the moon, as if it would cleave it
	in two.  The blade itself gleamed like a beacon in the night.
	There was no light source for the sword to be reflecting
	from, for the moon had darted behind a cloud in fear.  The
	sword was glowing from the intensity of its strength and
	power and knowledge that it was justice incarnate, and that
	after a slumber of uncounted years its time had again come.
	After the blade broke the surface, the hilt was visible, and
	holding the sword was a single strong, yet feminine hand,
	wearing several rings that bore jewels sparkling with the
	blue-green color of the ocean.
		[ Knight Life, by Peter David ]
expensive camera
	Always randomly generated uncursed with 30 to 99 charges.

	When applied in the direction of a monster that has eyes, the flash
	of an expensive camera (whose beam is represented by !) will blind
	that monster, as well as typically scaring it - applying a cursed
	camera has a 50% chance of blinding you for 1d25 turns instead
	when applied. Applying a camera at a sleeping monster will wake it
	up with no further effects. Gremlins will take d4 damage from
	the flash, which cannot kill them this way.

	Affected monsters that are adjacent are blinded permanently, while
	others that are farther away are blinded for up to 13 turns,
	depending on the distance. Monsters hit by the flash will also
	flee with a 3⁄4 chance, provided they are no more than 2 squares
	away from you - shopkeepers cannot be scared by the flash of an
	expensive camera.

	If wielded and used to attack, the expensive camera will break
	and do no damage; it shares this property with the cream pie.
	Breaking a camera in any way has a 1⁄3 chance of releasing a
	"picture-painting demon", which will be a homunculus 2⁄3 of the
	time and an imp the remaining 1⁄3 - the resulting demon will be
	peaceful unless the camera was cursed.

	Like most other tools, a camera has no limit on charging. Applying
	an unpaid expensive camera induces a 10% usage fee.


	There was a time when Rincewind had quite liked the iconoscope.

	specially treated paper, as he had surmised, but by the far
	simpler method of imprisoning a small demon with a good eye for
	colour and a speedy hand with a paintbrush.  He had been very

*fern*
    These dreadful weeds have been driven to extinction on the
    surface, yet deep within the dark and damp of the dungeon
    they still flourish. When it detects the motion of nearby
    creatures, the dungeon fern releases a deadly, poisonous
    spore, which quickly detonates to propagate the species.

    Residents of the dungeon have learned how not to disturb
    the dungeon fern, and will attack its spores on sight to
    keep them from overtaking their home.

    More than one variety of this plant is known to exist.
figurine*
	A figurine is a type of magical tool that appears in NetHack. It
	is vaguely similar to a miniature statue, and is made of mineral.

	You can apply one or cast stone to flesh on it to generate the
	depicted monster on a square next to you. Figurines weigh a fair
	amount, but are much easier to carry and animate than statues;
	they cannot be created by petrification, and cannot be destroyed
	with a pick-axe or wand of striking.

	Figurines are generated as a random monster, based upon a
	combination of your level at the time of its creation and the
	dungeon level; they are severely biased towards non-human monsters.
	Figurines are generated 75% uncursed, 12.5% blessed, and 12.5%
	cursed.

	Monsters brought to life from figurines will not have their
	starting inventory. You can bring a figurine to life by applying
	it or using the stoneto flesh spell. Applying a figurine will
	prompt the player for a direction and generate it on the square
	closest to them in that direction, while the latter method will
	cause it to animate on its current square (or next to the player
	if in their inventory).

	If a figurine is applied to a square with a monster on it, the
	figurine will be lost and nothing will be generate. Attempting to
	apply a figurine onto solid rock or a square containing a boulder
	will fail without using up the figure, but will generate the
	monster as normal if it has phasing. Applying a figurine > or < will
	always succeed even if you are surrounded by monsters, unless the
	entire level is filled. Applying a figurine respects genocide but
	does not respect extinction, except for monsters with special
	limits such as erinyes and Nazgul.

	A monster created from a figurine is most likely to be tame if the
	figurine was blessed, peaceful if it was uncursed, and hostile if
	it was cursed; however, even a blessed figurine may create a
	hostile monster, or a cursed figurine a tame monster. The odds are
	as follows:

	         tame     peaceful hostile
	blessed  80%      10%      10%
	uncursed 10%      80%      10%
	cursed   10%      10%      80%

	A cursed figurine will automatically transform anywhere between
	200 to 9200 turns after it is cursed or placed into an inventory -
	this timer starts whenever a cursed figurine is picked up or an
	existing figurine is cursed; dropping or uncursing the figurine
	will stop the timer. A figurine that transforms is treated
	as if you applied the figurine yourself, i.e. there is a 4/5 chance
	the monster will be hostile; if this transformation fails for any
	reason, the timer is set again for anywhere between one and 5000
	turns.

	Then it appeared in Paris at just about the time that Paris
	was full of Carlists who had to get out of Spain.  One of
	them must have brought it with him, but, whoever he was, it's
	likely he knew nothing about its real value.  It had been --
	no doubt as a precaution during the Carlist trouble in Spain
	-- painted or enameled over to look like nothing more than a
	fairly interesting black statuette.  And in that disguise,
	sir, it was, you might say, kicked around Paris for seventy
	years by private owners and dealers too stupid to see what
	it was under the skin.

fishing pole
	A fishing pole is a weapon-tool, which can be used as a polearm
	weapon. Its main use is to fish. Applying a fishing pole will
	prompt you for a location. The range of a fishing pole is the same
	as pounding with a regular polearm, but without a minimum range.

	Applying a fishing pole on a water square may have the following
	effects :
	- You hook yourself, dealing yourself 10-19 points of damage.
	- You hook an item on the target square, retrieving it.
	- You may "snag some garbage from the water", which gives you an
	  uncursed +0 pair of low boots. This can only occur once.
	- You catch tonight's dinner, a cram ration.

	Dry Land
	Note that you may still apply a fishing pole to a square when that
	square is on dry land. Usually, there is no need to do this, as
	most items may simply be picked up. However, if the item is at the
	bottom of a spiked pit, it might be safer to fish for the item than
	to try your luck with poisonous spikes. Also, for vampire players
	with their intrinsic flight, this is one of the few ways available
	to them to pick up items in the bottom of a pit.

	You may use a fishing pole on sinks and toilets, although this has
	no special use:

	- You hook yourself, dealing yourself 10-19 points of damage.
	- You hook an item on the target square, retrieving it.
	- You pull a sewer rat out of the sink.

	With an anxiety that almost amounted to agony, I collected
	the instruments of life around me, that I might infuse a spark
	of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet.  It was
	already one in the morning; the rain pattered dismally against
	the panes, and my candle was nearly burnt out, when, by the
	glimmer of the half-extinguished light, I saw the dull yellow
	eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive
	motion agitated its limbs.

	How can I describe my emotions at this catastrophe, or how
	delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care I
	had endeavoured to form?  His limbs were in proportion, and I
	had selected his features as beautiful.  Beautiful!--Great God!
	His yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and
	arteries beneath; his hair was of a lustrous black, and
	flowing; his teeth of a pearly whiteness; but these luxuriances
	only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes, that
	seemed almost of the same colour as the dun white sockets in

flintlock
	Flintlock is a general term for any firearm that uses a flint-
	striking ignition mechanism, the first of which appeared in
	Western Europe in the early 16th century. The term may also apply
	to a particular form of the mechanism itself, also known as the
	true flintlock, that was introduced in the early 17th century, and

floating eye
	Floating eyes, not surprisingly, are large, floating eyeballs
	which drift about the dungeon.  Though not dangerous in and
	of themselves, their power to paralyse those who gaze at
	their large eye in combat is widely feared.  Many are the
	tales of those who struck a floating eye, were paralysed by
	its mystic powers, and then nibbled to death by some other
	creature that lurked around nearby.

flute
	The flute is a tonal instrument that shares the same appearance
	with another flute, the magic flute.

	Applying the flute will prompt you to "improvise"; improvising
	with it will exercise your dexterity, while choosing not to
	improvise will let you play a specific set of notes. If the
	player has enough experience and dexterity, improvising may make
	nearby snakes peaceful. The snake-charming effect will occur if
	(1dDex + Xlvl) is 27 or greater.

	When played, it will either "trill" (which pacifies snakes) or
	"toot".
	With this thou canst do mighty deeds
	And change men's passions for thy needs:
	A man's despair with joy allay,
	Turn bachelors old to lovers gay.
		[ The Magic Flute, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart ]
magic flute
	A magic flute is a magical tonal instrument, and it can be used
	to play the passtune. Improvising with a charged magic flute will
	produce "soft music" ("piped" if hallucinating) and will put nearby
	monsters (including pets) to sleep unless they resist. It also exercises dexterity and consumes a charge.

	An uncharged magic flute behaves as a wooden flute.

	The usage fee for a charged magic flute is one quarter of the full
	price.


	Sleep resistance prevents this attack from succeeding. Monsters
	may also prevent the attack using their innate magic resistance.
	There is no message given if a monster falls asleep; the only
	indication without a stethoscope or similar tool is the lack of
	movement.

	Monsters are affected for 10d10 turns, after which they may be
	roused.

	The radius of the effect is SquareRt(XPlevel * 5) squares.

fortune cookie
	A fortune cookie is a comestible that has a scrap of paper inside
	with a random rumor. Unless you are blind, the fortune inside will
	automatically be read.

	Blessed fortune cookies always contain true rumors, cursed fortune
	cookies always contain false rumors, and uncursed fortune cookies
	may contain either. They will never be rotten when eaten,
	regardless of their beatitude. The fortune cookie can also be read
	normally, breaking and throwing away the cookie and reading the
	fortune inside.

	Reading the fortune breaks illiterate conduct.

	You can preserve vegan or foodless conduct by reading the cookie
	instead of eating it, which makes you break and throw away the
	actual cookie to read its paper. Illiterate conduct can be
	preserved by using it to tame pets as above; if they cannot be
	avoided entirely, you can blind yourself before eating the cookie.

~violet fungus
*fung*
	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

*gargoyle
	And so it came to pass that while Man ruled on Earth, the
	gargoyles waited, lurking, hidden from the light.  Reborn
	every 600 years in Man's reckoning of time, the gargoyles
	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.

	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men
	who flourished in greater numbers.  Now it has been so many
	hundreds of years that it seems the ancient statues and
	paintings of gargoyles are just products of Man's

*garlic
	A clove of garlic is a comestible with a few unusual uses. Garlic
	is an acceptable food for pets; you can use it to tame horses and
	feed herbivores.
	All undead dislike garlic, not only vampires(V).

	Garlic has the following effects:
	- If you polymorph into an undead monster, then eating garlic will
	  make you "feel incredibly sick" and cause you to vomit.
	- If you wield a clove of garlic, and use it to attack undead, it
	  will cause them to flee for 2d4 turns. The same should happen if
	  you throw garlic at them, but it must hit.
	- No undead except ghosts and shades will enter a square with a
	  clove of garlic on it. However, placing garlic on a stairway
	  does not prevent covetous undead, such as master liches, arch-
	  liches, or Vlad the Impaler, from warping to it.
	- Undead pets will not eat garlic.

	This herb will slowly propogate itself if left alone on the ground.

	1 November - All day long we have travelled, and at a good
	speed.  The horses seem to know that they are being kindly
	treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best
	speed.  We have now had so many changes and find the same
	thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the
	journey will be an easy one.  Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he
	tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays
	them well to make the exchange of horses.  We get hot soup,
	or coffee, or tea, and off we go.  It is a lovely country.
	Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are
	brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice
	qualities.  They are very, very superstitious.  In the first
	house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the
	scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two
	fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.  I believe they
	went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into
	our food, and I can't abide garlic.  Ever since then I have
	taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
	escaped their suspicions.

gauntlets
	A type of armored glove designed to protect the wrist and hand,
	usually made of metal or hardened leather and intended to be
	worn as part of a full suit of armor.

    Applies a -2 to-hit penalty when shooting from a bow.

    Crafting recipe: gauntlets = helmet + mace
gauntlets of dexterity
    Modifies the wearer's dexterity based on its enchantment, up to a
    maximum of 25. Wearing gauntlets of dexterity of any non-zero
    enchantment auto-identifies them.

    Applies a +1 to-hit bonus for using bows.
gauntlets of fumbling
    Causes fumbling when worn and are usually generated cursed.
    Wearing cursed gauntlets of fumbling is a minor trouble.
    They incur a −9 to-hit penalty with bows.
gauntlets of power
    Wearing gauntlets of power grants 1 AC and sets your strength to
    25 regardless of beatitude, auto-identifying them. They apply a
    -2 to-hit penalty when shooting from a bow. Strength cannot be
    exercised while wearing gauntlets of power, although actual
    strength increases will still occur as normal.

    Mjollnir can only be thrown by a character with 25 strength,
    which for all practical purposes requires gauntlets of power.
    As iron gloves, they interfere with spellcasting.

    Monsters wearing gauntlets of power add 3-6 damage to their
    weapon attacks, with no effect on monsters that cannot wield weapons.
gauntlets of protection
    "The best defense is a good offense."

	The forces of the gloom know each other, and are strangely

	have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out
	uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a
	shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem
	to them to live with a dead and terrible life.  These
	brutalities, which are only matter, entertain a confused fear
	of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an
	unknown being.  A black figure barring the way stops the wild
	beast short.  That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates

# gray stones
luckstone
luck stone
    Appears as a gray stone when unidentified.

    A magical item that modifies a player's base Luck and Luck timeout
    while carried, and appears as a gray stone when unidentified.

    Always generated uncursed with the exception of bones files. There
    is a guaranteed luckstone in each of the three variants of Mines'
    End.

    A noncursed luckstone adds 3 Luck, and can exceed the ordinary
    maximum of 10 in this way; and a cursed luckstone subtracts 3 Luck.
    Luckstones carried in containers (e.g. bags) have no effect on
    Luck.

    A cursed luckstone heavily slows the timeout of negative Luck,
    blessed ones heavily slow the timeout of positive Luck and
    uncursed ones slow both. For example, if you have a blessed
    luckstone and jump a lot in Sokoban, your total Luck will
    eventually time out to three. While carrying the Amulet of Yendor,
    Luck times out more rapidly unless it is prevented from timing
    out by a luckstone.

    A handful of other objects in the game, typically artifacts, can
    also function as luckstones (e.g. The Tsurugi of Muramasa and the
    The Orb of Fate). Multiple luckstones and/or luck items have no
    cumulative effect: you will get the blessed luckstone effect if
    you have strictly more blessed than cursed luck items in your
    open inventory, you get the cursed effect if you have more cursed
    luck items, and you get the uncursed effect if you have an equal
    amount of blessed and cursed luck items or all of them are
    uncursed.

    In EvilHack, a luckstone no longer prevents Luck from timing out,
    but instead heavily slows Luck timeout dependent on its beatitude;
    which beatitude affects the timeout of good and/or bad Luck is
    unchanged from vanilla NetHack.

    Items with the "excellence" object property act as luckstones when
    worn or wielded.
touchstone
touch stone
    Appears as a gray stone when unidentified.

    A touchstone is used to identify gems by applying the touchstone
    or rubbing a gem on it. A blessed touchstone will immediately
    identify the gem, as will an uncursed one in the hands of an
    archeologist or gnome; this includes both worthless glass and
    other gray stones, and will also auto-identify the touchstone. A
    non-blessed touchstone will merely distinguish glass from gems;
    valuable gems will leave streaks of the gem's color, while glass
    will leave scratch marks. A cursed touchstone has a 1⁄5 chance of
    shattering gems that are rubbed on it.

    Archaeologists always start with an uncursed touchstone, and one
    is always generated in the inventory of a jewelery shop's
    shopkeeper.
loadstone
load stone
lodestone
load stone
    Appears as a gray stone when unidentified.

    Normally-generated loadstones on the dungeon's floor are always
    generated cursed. 10⁄11 of loadstones inside containers are
    generated cursed; the other 1⁄11 of those are generated non-cursed.

    A loadstone weighs slightly more than an iron ball, and ultimately
    serves as a "gotcha" item for the unwary: if you pick a cursed one
    up, you cannot drop it or place it into a container. Any setting
    of the pickup_burden option will be ignored if the character
    attempts to pick up a loadstone, and other inventory restrictions
    may be ignored as well—if a character's inventory has already
    reached the 52-item limit, the loadstone will still be picked up
    and assigned # as the inventory position. A loadstone will
    autocurse once it is dropped or leaves your main inventory in any
    other way.

    Despite its weight, a loadstone does not do any more damage than
    a flint stone when thrown.

    Loadstones severely hinder your movement and often render you
    stressed or worse, which will prevent you from using up stairs;
    to get rid of a loadstone, you must typically uncurse it first.

    Infidels can freely drop or remove cursed items, including loadstones.
flint stone
flintstone
    Appears as a gray stone when unidentified, and is the only gray
    stone to be a non-magical item.

    All cavefolk start with a stack of flint stones and a sling to
    fire them with.

    Cavemen can also bang rocks together to make flint, and lash
    flint to arrows, making them more deadly.

sling bullet
    Appears as shiny stones when unidentified.
    Cavepeople of all types can start with sling bullets.

    Hobbits and hobbit pickpockets generated with a sling have a 1⁄3
    chance to carry 5-10 sling bullets, while caveperson player
    monsters will also generate with sling bullets.
whetstone
whet stone
    A whetstone is a gray stone from SlashEM that can remove rust
    (including corrosion) and negative enchantments (up to +0) from
    an edged weapon or a pick- axe. This action requires a source of
    water. Stand at some water and apply the whetstone.

    In HackEM whetstone have been overhauled to be more useful.

    The water sources that are available include puddles, pools,
    moats, sewage, rust traps, sinks, and toilets.

    If you are carrying water and no dungeon water is available, you
    will be prompted for a potion to use. If you use your bottled
    water, there is a 1d7 chance of using it up on each attempt.

    The whetstone's beatitude determines the chance of success.
    (Same for artifacts and non-artifacts)
    stone               chance of success
    blessed whestone    1/3
    uncursed whetstone  1/4
    cursed whestone     0
    other gray stone    0

    Blessed whetstones can also enchant non-corroded, uncursed,
    +0 weapons up to +1. (This might take a little longer because you
    need to pass a coin flip after your sharpening roll succeeds)

    Cursed whetstones instead have a chance of inflicting rust damage
    to your weapon. They will never sharpen.

    If you fail, you can try again. If you always fail, your gray
    stone is not a whetstone. If you succeed, you remove one level
    of rust; or if there was no rust, you remove one point of
    negative enchantment.

    When rubbed on an iron weapon with no water available, the
    whetstone will give the message "You need some water when you use
    that."

    If your gray stone is not a whetstone, then you will try to
    sharpen the edge, but your attempt will always fail.
healthstone
health stone
    A healthstone is a gray stone that modifies a player's heal rate.
    Blessed or uncursed healthstones increase it, cursed healthstones
    decrease it.

    Healthstones are always generated cursed.

    Unlike luckstones, healthstones are cumulative - two blessed
    healthstones are better than one. To be precise, you have a health
    recovery bonus which is 2 for each blessed healthstone in your main
    inventory, plus 1 for each uncursed healthstone, minus 2 for each
    cursed healthstone. This bonus is added to your level and
    constitution when calculating how fast or how much you heal, i.e.
    if you carry 2 blessed healthstones at level 1 you will regenerate
    every 7th turn (as at level 5) instead of every 15th, and at level
    29 you will regenerate 1d24 HP instead of 1d20 (provided your
    constitution is 20).
goggles
	Goggles are worn in the same slot as lenses or a blindfold, and
	allow the wearer to see at a distance whilst underwater. They can
	protect your eyes under certain circumstance just as regular
	lenses can. Goggles are	made of plastic and are black in color.
	They are non-magical, but are more rare than lenses.
grayswandir
	Why had I been wearing Grayswandir?  Would another weapon have
	affected a Logrus-ghost as strongly?  Had it really been my
	father, then, who had brought me here?  And had he felt I might
	need the extra edge his weapon could provide?  I wanted to
	think so, to believe that he had been more than a Pattern-ghost.

		  James Jacobs, and Erik Mona ]
*grease
can of grease
	A can of grease is used to grease items for various purposes. The
	oilskin cloak and oilskin sack act as "permanently greased" objects.

	Applying a can of grease can be used to slather any item (except
	zorkmids) in a thick layer of grease, and you can also select - to
	grease your hands - doing either will use up one charge. Greased
	cans can hold a maximum of 50 charges; uncursed charging adds 1-5
	charges, while blessed charging adds 5-10 charges, or 6-15 if
	there are fewer than 10 charges left.

	Greased objects are protected from erosion and water damage;
	greased containers protect their contents from water damage, and
	greased spellbooks, potions and scrolls are protected from blanking
	or dilution. Greased armor on the outermost layer (e.g. usually a
	cloak or helm) can also protect against attacks that target body
	parts covered by that object; if the greased piece of armor is
	cursed, there is only a 2/3 chance that it will protect you.

	Grease has a 50% chance to wear off after each successful
	protection. Greased items may slip when you attempt to throw them,
	similar to cursed projectiles, and will slide further along the
	floor than normal when kicked. A greased weapon has no additional
	protection from a bullwhip's disarm attack, nor does the grease
	unweld cursed weapons; greasing quest artifacts or the Amulet of
	Yendor will not prevent covetous monsters from stealing them from
	your inventory.

	Applying a cursed can of grease has only a 50% chance of being
	successful and will give you slippery fingers; the other 50% of the
	time, the can will slip from your grasp and drop to the ground,
	using up a charge. Applying a non-cursed can while fumbling also
	only works 50% of the time, though it does not spill grease on your
	hands.

	A can of grease can be used to untrap squeaky boards.
	ANOINT, v.t.  To grease a king or other great functionary
	already sufficiently slippery.

	to great lengths to inflict pain or cause injury.
		[]

	Suddenly, Wilson thought about war, about the newspaper
	stories which recounted the alleged existence of creatures in
	the sky who plagued the Allied pilots in their duties.  They
	called them gremlins, he remembered.  Were there, actually,

	riding on the wind, apparently of bulk and weight, yet
	impervious to gravity?
	He was thinking that when the man appeared again.

gr?y*elf
	Grey elves have either silver hair and amber eyes, or pale
	golden hair and violet eyes (the violet-eyed ones are known as
	faerie elves). They favor bright garments of white, gold, silver,
	or yellow, and wear cloaks of deep blue or purple. Grey elves are
	the rarest of elves, and they have little to do with the world
	outside their forests. They value intelligence very highly, and,
	unlike other elves, devote much time to study and contemplation.
	Their treatises on nature are astounding.

grid bug
	These electronically based creatures are not native to this
	universe.  They appear to come from a world whose laws of
	motion are radically different from ours.
		[]

	Tron looked to his mate and pilot.  "I'm going to check on
	the beam connection, Yori.  You two can keep a watch out for
	grid bugs."  Tron paced forward along the slender catwalk
	that still seemed awfully insubstantial to Flynn, though he
	knew it to be amazingly sturdy.  He gazed after Tron, asking
	himself what in the world a grid bug was, and hoping that the
	beam connection -- to which he'd given no thought whatsoever
	until this moment -- was healthy and sound."

	"Nature's revenge for bug zappers," replied his companion.
grumbar
	Much like earth itself, Grumbar may seem indifferent, uncaring,
	and resistant to change, but also represents a stability,
	consistency, and resolution that is especially appealing to
	those followers who worship him as the Elemental Lord of Earth.
gug
	These foul creatures dwell in the endless darkness of the
	Gulf of N'Kai, scavenging the bones of whatever luckless
	intruders have stumbled into it.  It is suspected that they
	may be some warped form of ghoul, but few have survived
	seeing them so information is scarce.
guisarme
	Medieval peasants discovered that their pruning hooks made
	reasonably effective pole arms. The result: the guisarme.
	It is furnished with a sharp cutting edge along its convex
	side, with a reverse spike to hook. The spike can be used
	to penetrate armor when the weapon is swung, and the curved
	hook provides an ample means of pulling horsemen to the ground.
gunyoki
	The samurai's last meal before battle.  It was usually made
	up of cooked chestnuts, dried seaweed, and sake.
hachi
	Hachi was a dog that went with his master, a professor, to
	the Shibuya train station every morning.  In the afternoon,
	when his master was to return from work Hachi would be there
	waiting.  One day his master died at the office, and did not
	return.  For over ten years Hachi returned to the station
	every afternoon to wait for his master.  When Hachi died a
	statue was erected on the station platform in his honor.  It
	is said to bring you luck if you touch his statue.
harp
	A harp is a type of tonal musical instrument; it appears as just a
	harp when unidentified.

	For Samurai, the wooden harp is called a koto.

	Applying a harp will play it; improvising will typically cause it
	to "twang", while trying to play specific notes producesa "strange
	sound", and both have no effect beyond exercising dexterity. If
	you are not confused, there is a chance that it will instead play
	"a lilting melody" that pacifies any nymphs nearby; for this to
	occur, the sum of your experience level and a randomly rolled
	number between 0 and your current dexterity stat must exceed 25.
	A triangular stringed instrument, often Magic.  Even when not
	Magic, a Harp is surprisingly portable and tough and can be
	carried everywhere on the back of the Bard or Harper in all
	weathers.  A Harp seldom goes out of tune and never warps.
	Its strings break only in very rare instances, usually
	because the Harper is sulking or crossed in love.  This is
	just as well as no one seems to make or sell spare strings.
		[ The Tough Guide to Fantasyland, by Diana Wynne Jones ]

	After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: "Wife, wife,
	bring me my golden harp."  So she brought it and put it on
	the table before him.  Then he said: "Sing!" and the golden
	harp sang most beautifully.  And it went on singing till the
	ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder.
	Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down
	like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the
	table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and
	dashed with it towards the door.  But the harp called out
	quite loud: "Master!  Master!" and the ogre woke up just in
	time to see Jack running off with his harp.
		[ Jack and the Beanstalk, from English Fairy Tales,
		  by Joseph Jacobs ]
magic harp
	A magic harp is a tonal musical instrument, and one of the two harps.

	Magic harps are created with 1-8 charges.

	If it has any charges left when applied, then it produces "very
	attractive music" which tames monsters around you and exercises
	your dexterity. A magic harp with no charges left behaves as a
	normal wooden harp.

	The magic harp can be charged an unlimited number of times; it
	gains 1d4 charges with an uncursed scroll of charging, or 2d4 with
	a blessed scroll, and can hold a maximum of 20 charges.

	The radius of effect depends on your experience level.
halberd
	This form of a pole axe is seen as a convex-headed broad axe
	in early examples, but the head is set at a convenient angle,
	considering the point where the blade is most likely to impact
	upon an enemy. This alone makes it quite distinct from an
	ordinary long-hafted axe. The whole weapon reaches 8 feet in length,
	and is nearly always topped with a long spear point and backed by
	a spike, which was often angled or hooked slightly downward.
	The spear point is, of course, designed to keep opponents at bay
	and deliver a thrusting attack (this proves quite useless when
	opposing mounted knights armed with lances). The opposing spike was
	for penetration of heavy plate armor, with a secondary function as a
	hook for dismounting opponents.
hawaiian*shirt
    A shirt is a piece of armor worn underneath body armor.
    All Tourists start with a +0 Hawaiian shirt.

    If you go shopping when wearing a Hawaiian shirt and the
    shopkeeper sees it (i.e., there is no body armor or cloak over
    it), he will charge an extra 1/3 markup and buy things for
    1/3 of the base price.

    Hawaiian shirts can be (r)ead to observe the design on the apparel.

	'One of the things he can't do, he can't ride a horse,' he
	said.  Then he stiffened as if sandbagged by a sudden
	recollection, gave a small yelp of terror and dashed into
	the gloom.  When he returned, the being called Twoflower was
	hanging limply over his shoulder.  It was small and skinny,
	and dressed very oddly in a pair of knee-length britches and
	a shirt in such a violent and vivid conflict of colours that
	the Weasel's fastidious eye was offended even in the half-light.
		[ The Colour of Magic, by Terry Pratchett ]
t?shirt
    A shirt is a piece of armor worn underneath body armor.

    If you go shopping when wearing a T-shirt and the shopkeeper sees
    it (i.e., there is no body armor or cloak over it), he will charge
    an extra 1/3 markup and buy things for 1/3 of the base price.

    Reading a T-shirt will display a message. The message is dependent
    on the item's object ID, so it will remain consistent for any one
    T-shirt. If the shirt is eroded, some of the text might be altered,
    just as an engraving would be. Reading a T-shirt breaks the
    illiterate conduct.

	my mind paralyzed by the dreadful shape which had sprung out
	upon us from the shadows of the fog.  A hound it was, an
	enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal eyes
	have ever seen.  Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes
	glowed with a smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and
	dewlap were outlined in flickering flame.  Never in the
	delirious dream of a disordered brain could anything more
	savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that

helm of brilliance
	Modifies the wearer's Intelligence and Wisdom by its amount of
	enchantment, in addition to its normal AC bonus. Wearing an
	enchanted helm of brilliance will auto-identify it, as will
	enchanting the helm at +0. Even though the helm of brilliance is
	iron, it does not hinder spellcasting.
helm of opposite alignment
    Switch you to the alignment opposite your current one when worn -
    this will autocurse the helm, remove any divine protection you
    have acquired and set your alignment record to zero (even if it
    was previously negative).

    Removing the helm will restore your original alignment and remove
    any protection obtained under your temporary alignment; wearing
    or removing the helm will never restore any lost points of
    protection or alignment record. Attempting to put one on while in
    the Quest branch will always fail and give a specific message -
    this will still remove any divine protection, but does not affect
    your alignment record.

    A lawful character donning the helm will become chaotic, and a
    chaotic character donning the helm will become lawful. For
    neutral characters, there is a a 50/50 chance of the helm
    switching them to lawful or chaotic, and each individual helm
    will always switch to the same alignment. While the helm does
    not change the alignment of monsters, aligned priests and minions
    (whose alignment is linked to their god) will refuse to put it on.

    If your god was angry with you prior to wearing the helm, your
    "new" god will retain the previous god's anger status. Ascending
    while wearing a helm of opposite alignment will cut your score by
    2⁄3.

    Gods will not consider a worn cursed helm of opposite alignment
    as trouble, and will not uncurse a worn helm of opposite alignment
    as a favor, to prevent you from switching allegiance to a
    different god.

    Usually generated cursed.
helm of speed
    Allows the wearer to become very fast when worn.
tinfoil hat
    When worn, provides extrinsic psychic resistance.

    The tin foil hat protects the wearer from damage from a (master)
    mind flayer's psychic blast, with the downside that it also
    prevents the wearer from sensing monsters by telepathy.

    Crafting recipe: tinfoil hat = dented pot + dunce cap
helm of madness
    Autocurses and causes hallucination when worn. Grants +3 charisma.
    Usually generated cursed.
helm of telepathy
    When worn, the helm grants 1 AC and extrinsic telepathy, but does
    not auto-identify. Despite being a mind-enhancing helmet, it has
    the same adverse effects on spellcasting as most other metal helms.
hermes
	Messenger and herald of the Olympians.  Being required to do
	a great deal of travelling and speaking in public, he became
	the god of eloquence, travellers, merchants, and thieves.  He
	was one of the most energetic of the Greek gods, a
	Machiavellian character full of trickery and sexual vigour.
	Like other Greek gods, he is endowed with not-inconsiderable
	sexual prowess which he directs towards countryside nymphs.
	He is a god of boundaries, guardian of graves and patron deity
	of shepherds.  He is usually depicted as a handsome young
	man wearing winged golden sandals and holding a magical
	herald's staff consisting of intertwined serpents, the
	kerykeion.  He is reputedly the only being able to find his way
	to the underworld ferry of Charon and back again.  He is said
	to have invented, among other things, the lyre, Pan's Pipes,
	numbers, the alphabet, weights and measures, and sacrificing.

	is believed to have been born on the island of Cos, to have
	studied under his father, a physician, to have traveled for
	some time, perhaps studying in Athens, and to have then
	returned to practice, teach, and write at Cos.  The
	Hippocratic or Coan school that formed around him was of
	enormous importance in separating medicine from superstition

hobbit
	Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more

	and did not understand or like machines more complicated
	than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a handloom, although
	they were skillful with tools.  Even in ancient days they

hobgoblin
	Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for
	wicked goblin spirits, as in Bunyan's "Hobgoblin nor foul
	friend", but its more correct use is for the friendly spirits

	fairy says to Shakespeare's Puck:
		Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
		You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
		Are you not he?

	if that was an ill-omened word.
	Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
	helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
	fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the
	verge of hobgoblindom.  Bogles are just over the edge.
	One Hob mentioned by Henderson, was Hob Headless who haunted
	the road between Hurworth and Neasham, but could not cross
	the little river Kent, which flowed into the Tess.  He was
	exorcised and laid under a large stone by the roadside for
	ninety-nine years and a day.  If anyone was so unwary as to
	sit on that stone, he would be unable to quit it for ever.
	The ninety-nine years is nearly up, so trouble may soon be
	heard of on the road between Hurworth and Neasham.

holy wafer
	Any player can eat a holy wafer to cure their sickness and
	lycanthropy.
	Lawful players will also heal by 20 to 39 HP;
	Chaotic players will lose 10 to 19 HP, but will not go below 1 HP.

	Holy wafers can be considered a better version of wolfsbane, since:
		- They weigh the same.
		- They can be eaten in the same time.
		- They are both vegan.
		- Holy wafers also cure sickness.
		- Holy wafers provide nearly quadruple the nutrition.
		- Holy wafers heal Lawful players.
		- Only Chaotic players lose health.
holy water
	"We want a word with you," said Ligur (in a tone of voice
	intended to imply that "word" was synonymous with "horrifically
	painful eternity"), and the squat demon pushed open the office
	door.
	The bucket teetered, then fell neatly on Ligur's head.
	Drop a lump of sodium in water.  Watch it flame and burn and
	spin around crazily, flaring and sputtering.  This was like
	that, just nastier.
	The demon peeled and flared and flickered.  Oily brown smoke
	oozed from it, and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed.
	Then it crumpled, folded in on itself, and what was left lay
	glistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet, looking
	like a handful of mashed slugs.
	"Hi," said Crowley to Hastur, who had been walking behind Ligur,
	and had unfortunately not been so much as splashed.
	There are some things that are unthinkable; there are some
	depths that not even demons would believe other demons would
	stoop to.

* hom*nculus
	A homunculus is a creature summoned by a mage to perform some
	particular task.  They are particularly good at spying.  They
	are smallish creatures, but very agile.  They can put their
	victims to sleep with a venomous bite, but due to their size,
	the effect does not last long on humans.

honey badger
ratel
	The Honey badger (or ratel) is a tenacious small carnivore that
	has a reputation for being, pound for pound, Africa's most fearless
	animal despite its small size.  It is even listed as the "most
	fearless animal in the world" in the Guinness Book of Records.

	Honey badgers are reputed to go for the scrotum when attacking large
	animals.  The first published record of this behaviour was a
	circumstantial account by Stevenson-Hamilton (1947) where a badger
	reportedly castrated an adult Buffalo.  Other animals alleged to have
	been emasculated by honey badgers include wildebeest, waterbuck, kudu,
	zebra and man.  This has also been reported by other African tribes,
	but no direct evidence exists to support this behaviour.
# also gets 'pruning hook' aka guisarme
*hook
grappling hook
	A grappling hook is also a weapon that uses the flail skill.

	You can apply a grappling hook to a location up to a distance
	determined by your skill in the use of flails:

	.......
	.ESUSE.  U = Unskilled/Basic
	.SUUUS.  S = Skilled
	.UU@UU.  E = Expert
	.SUUUS.
	.ESUSE.
	.......

	You can only apply the hook at a space you can see without astral
	vision.

	Possible Outcomes
	You can attempt to grab an item on that square, drag yourself
	towards a spot on the ground, attack a monster, drag a tiny monster
	to you, or you may end up accidentally hitting yourself (doing 10-
	19 points of damage). You cannot hit yourself if you are Skilled
	or Expert.

	If you are Unskilled or Basic, there are equal chances of nothing
	happening, hitting an item, hitting a monster, hitting the ground,
	or hooking yourself. If you are at least Skilled, you can select
	which target you are aiming for. If Skilled, you have a 50% chance
	of achieving what you try to, and a 95% chance at Expert; otherwise,
	there are equal chances of each outcome other than hooking yourself.
	If you can't decide which to choose, you may type enter to trigger
	a random effect.

	If you select or get an item or monster as a target, and there is
	no such thing present on the target space, nothing happens.

	Grabbing Items
	When grabbing an item, you will always snag the item that was last
	dropped on that square. Only one item from the stack at a time can
	be snagged this way. This can be used to snag items from the
	ground while levitating.

	Dragging Yourself
	When dragging yourself towards the ground, you will only be dragged
	one square. If you are trapped, you instead remain trapped and may
	take further damage from the trap.

	Monsters
	A tiny monster may be dragged with a 25% probability; otherwise,
	it is simply hit. Larger monsters are always hit. When grappling a
	monster that is at least of large size and/or strong, there is a
	25% chance that you will be pulled toward the ground instead,
	unless the space has water or air, in which case there is no effect.
	But as for Queequeg -- why, Queequeg sat there among them --
	at the head of the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an
	icicle.  To be sure I cannot say much for his breeding.  His
	greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his
	bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him, and using it
	there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it, to
	the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the
	beefsteaks towards him.

~unicorn horn
tooled horn
	A tooled horn is a tonal musical instrument, and the only non-
	magical horn.

	Improvising with it will awaken (and possibly scare) nearby
	monsters - including pets - and will abuse your wisdom. Monsters
	are awakened if their distance to you is at most 5.48 times the
	root of your level, and are scared (if not resisted) if their
	distance to you is at most 3.16 times the root of your level. They
	have the usual resistance roll against the scare effect. BUC status
	has no effect.

	It can be used to play the passtune to enter the castle.

	Roland hath set the Olifant to his mouth,
	He grasps it well, and with great virtue sounds.
	High are those peaks, afar it rings and loud,
	Thirty great leagues they hear its echoes mount.
	So Charles heard, and all his comrades round;
	Then said that King: "Battle they do, our counts!"
	And Guenelun answered, contrarious:
	"That were a lie, in any other mouth."
		[ The Song of Roland ]
frost horn
fire horn
	The fire horn and frost horn are rare musical instruments that can
	deal elemental damage. They both start with 4 to 8 charges.

	Applying a fire or frost horn with charges left will prompt you to
	improvise; if you answer yes, the game will ask the player for a
	direction, and the horn will emit a ray of fire or cold
	respectively. This will auto-identify the horn.

	For each application of the horn, a number X is chosen between 6
	and 11 inclusive. Each monster hit with the ray will then be
	dealt Xd6 damage, unless it resists the respective element.
	(Contrast this with the respective wands, for which the X always
	equals 6.) Frost horns also deal Xd3 additional damage to monsters
	resistant to fire but not to cold, and fire horns deal 7 extra
	damage to monsters resistant to cold but not to fire.

	An uncharged fire or frost horn behaves the same as a tooled horn;
	answering no to the "Improvise?" prompt also lets you play the horn
	as a musical instrument without using up any charges.

	The horn can be recharged an unlimited number of times, but can
	only hold up to 20 charges at once. Each recharge adds 1d4 charges,
	or 2d4 if the scroll is blessed.
horn of blasting
	Deals sonic damage when applied, similar to the Fire and frost horn.

horn of plenty
cornucopia
	A horn of plenty is one of the magical horns, but unlike the other
	horns, it cannot be used as a musical instrument. It is created
	with 1 to 20 charges and it may contain up to 50 charges. When
	applied, it produces food (including royal jelly) or a potion of
	water, fruit juice, booze, acid, sickness, or oil. The BUC of the
	item produced is the same as that of the horn.

	12/13 of the time, a horn of plenty produces a comestible.
	Multiples may be created if the food code permits. The remaining
	1/13 of the time, the horn produces a potion.

	There is a very small chance (about 1/250) that the potion generated
	will be a blood-red potion. This potion has an 80% chance of being
	a potion of blood, and a 20% chance of being a potion of vampire
	blood. Other than the starting inventories of vampires, this is
	the only time blood-red potions are generated anywhere in the game.

	The infant Zeus was fed with goat's milk by Amalthea,
	daughter of Melisseus, King of Crete.  Zeus, in gratitude,
	broke off one of the goat's horns, and gave it to Amalthea,
	promising that the possessor should always have in abundance
	everything desired.

    Corpses in an ice box will not age and will remain fit to eat or
    sacrifice indefinitely. They will continue decaying where they
    left off when removed from the box, and will be tainted if they
     were before being placed in the box.

    Ice boxes are waterproof. They have no locks. Potions do not
    freeze or shatter in an ice box. Since they're made of plastic,
    gelatinous cubes cannot eat ice boxes, which makes them good for
    stashes.

	Little is known about the Faceless Lord, even the correct
	spelling of his name.  He does not have a physical form as
	we know it, and those who have peered into his realm claim
	he is a slime-like creature who swallows other creatures
	alive, spits acidic secretions, and causes disease in his
	victims which can be almost instantly fatal.

c?ration
	The C ration was a predecessor of the K ration.
k?ration
	The K ration was the [ Quartermaster Subsistence Research
	and Development Laboratory's ] answer to the demand for an
	individual, easy-to-carry ration that could be used in
	assault and combat operations.  It was noted for compactness
	and superior packaging and was acknowledged as the ration
	that provided the greatest variety of nutritionally balanced
	components within the smallest space.

kabuto
	The kabuto is the helmet worn by the samurai.  It was
	characterized by a prominent beaked front which jutted out over
	the brow to protect the wearer's face; a feature that gives
	rise to their modern Japanese name of 'shokaku tsuki kabuto'
	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by
	a small plate, the shoshaku tei ita, whose rear edge bent
	downwards into a flange that rested against the forehead.

    It is only generated under water: 1/10 chance of being generated

    Can be fed to herbivorous pets, though it counts only as food
    and not as a treat like apples.
    This herb will slowly propogate itself if left alone in the water.

	I noticed that all the plants were attached to the soil by
	an almost imperceptible bond.  Devoid of roots, they seemed
	not to require any nourishment from sand, soil, or pebble.
	All they required was a point of support -- nothing else.
	These plants are self-propagated, and their existence depends
	entirely on the water that supports and nourishes them.
	Most of them do not sprout leaves, but sprout blades of
	various whimsical shapes, and their colors are limited to
	pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, and brown.  I had the
	opportunity to observe once more -- not the dried specimens
	I had studied on the _Nautilus_ -- but the fresh, living
	specimens in their native setting.

	The kelps generally include the many large brown seaweeds and
	are among the most familiar forms found on North American coasts.
	Some have fronds up to 200 ft (61 m) long, e.g., the Pacific coast
	Nereocystis and Macrocystis, found also off the Cape of Good Hope.
	Common Atlantic species include Laminaria and Agarum (devil's apron).
	The kelps are a source of salts of iodine and potassium and, to a
	lesser extent, other minerals. When the seaweed is burned, the
	soluble mineral compounds are removed from the ashes (also called kelp)
	by washing. They are used chiefly as chemical reagents and for
	dietary deficiencies in people and in livestock. Kelp is also a
	commercial source of potash, fertilizer, and medicines made from its
	vitamin and mineral content. Kelps are especially abundant in Japan,
	and various foods known as kombu are made from them.

    When worn, kicking boots add a +5 damage bonus to kick attacks
    (unless the target is thick-skinned) and give them a chance to
    make an enemy "reel", knocking them backwards. Kicking boots also
    increase the distance that kicked objects travel, and will

*ki-rin
	The ki-rin is a strange-looking wingless flying creature.
	It has scales, a mane like a lion, a tail, four legs with

	and can usually be found flying in the sky looking for good
	deeds to reward.

	An eldritch ki-rin is one that started its celestial life as
	a normal lawful ki-rin, and at some point lost its way and
	started following a path of darkness.  In nearly all aspects,
	they are identical to their lawful brethren. The differences
	are that their alignment is strongly chaotic, and their
	appearance is extremely dark.

	Ector took both his sons to the church before which the

	off the steel.  "Now it is your turn", Ector said facing
	Arthur.
	The young man lifted the sword and thrust with both arms; the
	blade whizzed through the air with a flash and drilled the
	metal as if it were mere butter.  Ector and Kay dropped to
	their knees before Arthur.
	"Why, father and brother, do you bow before me?", Arthur asked
	with wonder in his voice.
	"Because now I know for sure that you are the king, not only
	by birth but also by law", Ector said.  "You are no son of
	mine nor are you Kay's brother.  Immediately after your birth,

*kobold*
	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
komodo*
	The people of Komodo call this animal "ora." Elsewhere it is known
	as the Komodo Island monitor or more popularly, the Komodo dragon.
	Oras can reach 10 feet in length and weigh 300 pounds or more --
	particularly after a meal. They are the top predators in their
	habitat, feeding on wild boar, deer, water buffalo, dogs, goats,
	rats, snakes, birds, other oras, and -- once in a great while --
	humans. They hunt by ambush, hiding in the scrub brush along trails
	and in the tall grass of the savannas. Despite their lumbering
	appearance, oras can move with alarming speed when they want to,
	lunging from their hiding places and sprinting toward their
	startled victims. They can't sustain a long chase, but often all
	they need to subdue their prey is one bite. Oras carry poisonous
	bacteria in their mouths so even if they don't immediately catch
	their prey, the attack is often fatal. Using their long forked
	tongues (oras and other monitor lizards are closely related to
	snakes), they track the scent of their prey as the wounded animal
	slowly weakens from the infected bite -- a process that can take
	several days. When the victim can no longer flee, the ora moves
	in for the kill. Oras are voracious eaters. They devour every bit
	of their prey -- bones, fur, hooves -- ripping off huge chunks with
	their razor-sharp serrated teeth and swallowing the pieces whole.

*kop*
rubber hose
	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept
	policemen and display them over and over again in a series of
	riotously funny physical punishments plays equally well to the
	peanut gallery and the expensive box seats.  People hate cops.
	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.

	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all
	of Kansas City, and they ran into each other.  There is both
	poetry and philosophy in this fact, but most of all, there is
	humor.  Sennett got the humor.)

	In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die."

	Blind Io took up the dice-box, which was a skull whose various

	his eyes on the Lady he rolled three fives.  She smiled.  This
	was the nature of the Lady's eyes:  they were bright green,
	lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.

	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on
	the board with two decisive clicks.  The rest of the players,
	as one God, craned forward to peer at them.

	"A wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk," said Offler the
	Crocodile God, hindered as usual by his tusks.  "Well,
	weally!"  With one claw he pushed a pile of bone-white tokens
	into the centre of the table.

	it as steady as a rock, yet all the Gods could hear the three
	cubes rattling about inside.  And then she sent them bouncing
	across the table.

	Something was happening to the five, however.  Battered by the

    Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp

land mine
	A land mine is a tool that can be carried around, and then applied
	to produce a land mine trap.

	If you #untrap an activated land mine trap, it will turn (back)
	into the land mine item.

	Activated land mines are only randomly generated at dungeon level
	6 or lower. There are also many in the treasure room in Fort
	Ludios.

	Trying to set a land mine while fumbling, or setting a cursed
	landmine has a chance of detonating it instead. The chance is
	modified by Luck; if your Luck is maxed, the chances are very slim.
	Setting a land mine while riding a steed with Unskilled in Riding
	has the same chance of failure, and an even worse chance if also
	fumbling or using a cursed landmine, also causing it to detonate.

	Land mines explode when triggered, which will do 1-16 damage, wound
	your legs and leave behind a pit. You may untrap a land mine from
	an adjacent square, and then pick it up and install it elsewhere,
	similar to a bear trap.

	Monsters have only a 1 in 3 chance of setting off a land mine when
	they step on one. Flying creatures are even less likely to set
	one off (and won't ever fall in the resulting pit), although there
	is still a slim chance that air currents will activate the mine.
	Land mines can also be set off by rolling boulders.

	Any items on the same square as an active land mine will be
	blasted around the room (or destroyed, if fragile) when it goes
	off.

	A land mine that is triggered adjacent to a body of water like a
	pool or moat will create a pit that immediately fills with water,
	likely immersing you in the process.

	Your heart is intact, your brain is not badly damaged, but the rest
	of your injuries are comparable to stepping on a land mine.  You'd
	never walk again, and you'd be in great pain.  You would come to
	wish you had not survived.

lava
* lava
	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you
	is an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava
	come surging out, cascading back down into the depths.  The
	glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavern with a
	blood-red glare, giving everything an eerie, macabre appearance.
	The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy
	smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the
	thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.
	Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
	formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the
	murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one
	side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured
	rock which seems to have been crafted by the devil himself.
	An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the
	volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a
	bottomless pit far off to your left.  To the right, an immense
	geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren
	island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
	ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence
	of its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the
	already hellish scene.  A dark, forboding passage exits to the
	south.

		[ The Prophet, by Kahlil Gibran ]
leash
	A leash is a tool for keeping your pets close to you, especially
	when using stairs or portals.

	To attach a leash to a pet, apply the leash to a pet that is
	adjacent to you. You can have up to two pets leashed at the same
	time, using two separate leashes. As of NetHack 3.6.3, the pet in
	question cannot be unsolid and must have an extremity that the
	leash can actually be put on.

	To remove a leash from a pet, simply apply the leash to the pet
	that the leash is connected to. A cursed leash cannot be removed
	from the pet.

	Putting a leash on a pet will affect the way the pet moves and
	attacks, most of the time keeping it closer to you and acting more
	passively.

	If you move too far away from your leashed pet, it may "yowl" or
	make some other angry noise. While this will not hurt your pet
	(when using a non-cursed leash), the yowling can wake up other
	nearby monsters. With a cursed leash, this can choke your pet,
	dealing d2 damage to it and has a chance of reducing its tameness.
	If your pet is low on hit points, this can kill it.

	If you get even further away from your pet, a non-cursed leash will
	harmlessly snap loose from your pet, but a cursed leash will
	strangle your pet and kill it. You can get too far away by simply
	walking faster than your pet or moving while it is stuck around a
	corner or behind a door.

	Teleporting when your leashed pet is not adjacent will cause the
	pet to jump to your location before you teleport, and the now-
	adjacent pet will follow you through the teleport; this will
	happen even if your pet is eating. However, if you are riding one
	pet while leashed to another, your leashed pet must be adjacent to
	teleport with you.

	When changing levels (traps, stairs, portals) when your pet is not
	adjacent or can't follow you, the leash will be harmlessly removed,
	even if it is cursed.

	A leashed pet will not want to move more than two squares away
	from you. Be aware that leashed pets will also not attack monsters
	that are not adjacent to you, unless that monster is exactly two
	cells above, below, or to the side of you.

	A pet that becomes unleashed by a trap (level teleport, trap door,
	hole, etc.) loses 1 point of tameness.

	A pet choked by a cursed leash may lose 1 point of tameness. This
	will never reduce tameness below 1.  The chance of this -1 loss
	being waived is 1 in tameness.

	They had splendid heads, fine shoulders, strong legs, and
	straight tails.  The spots on their bodies were jet-black and
	mostly the size of a two-shilling piece; they had smaller
	spots on their heads, legs, and tails.  Their noses and eye-
	rims were black.  Missis had a most winning expression.
	Pongo, though a dog born to command, had a twinkle in his
	eye.  They walked side by side with great dignity, only
	putting the Dearlys on the leash to lead them over crossings.

*leech
	The commonest leeches in these hills are slender brown ones,
	like bits of dark whipcord when empty, but rapidly "swelling
	visibly" under the influence of draughts of blood into glossy
	black sausages, resembling well-fed garden-slugs.  A very brief
	visit to their domains at a time of year when the local conditions
	favour their activity will suffice to secure an unpleasant
	familiarity with their appearance, manners, and customs; for,
	should any brief halt be made on the moist and mossy surfaces of
	the stones marking the line of what is supposed to represent a
	path, they are almost sure to attract attention as they come
	eagerly trooping inwards from all quarters and converge upon their
	prey; and, unless he have skillfully protected himself, the wayfarer
	is almost certain to end his day's march bearing a burden of clammy,
	black vampires, hanging in wreaths around his ankles and occupying
	scattered outpost all along the course of his legs.

lembas*
	Has the highest nutrition/weight ratio of all the comestibles at
	800 nutrition to 5 units - lembas wafers provide 1000 nutrition
	for elves, and only 600 nutrition for orcs. Lembas wafers can also
	tame cats and dogs.

	In the morning, as they were beginning to pack their slender
	goods, Elves that could speak their tongue came to them and
	brought them many gifts of food and clothing for their
	journey.  The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes,
	made of a meal that was baked a light brown on the outside,
	and inside was the colour of cream.  Gimli took up one of the
	cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.
	'Cram,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a crisp
	corner and nibbled at it.  His expression quickly changed,
	and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.
	'No more, no more!' cried the Elves laughing.  'You have
	eaten enough already for a long day's march.'
	'I thought it was only a kind of cram, such as the Dalemen
	make for journeys in the wild,' said the Dwarf.
	'So it is,' they answered.  'But we call it lembas or

	small, has dark skin and wears strange clothes.  His nature
	has something of the manic-depressive about it:  first he
	is quite happy, whistling merrily as he nails a sole on to a
	shoe; a few minutes later, he is sullen and morose, drunk
	on his home-made heather ale.  The Leprechaun's two great
	loves are tobacco and whiskey, and he is a first-rate con-man,
	impossible to out-fox.  No one, no matter how clever, has ever
	managed to cheat him out of his hidden pot of gold or his

	twinkling of an eye.

sparkling water
	The Lethe is a river, slow, dark and deep, which flows from

*lich
eye of fear and flame
eye of flame and fear
	Once in a great while, an evil master wizard or priest will
	manage through use of great magics to extend his or her life
	far beyond the normal span of a human. The usual effect of
	this is to transform the human, over time, into an undead of
	great magical power. A Lich hates life in any form; even a
	touch from one of these creatures will cause a numbing cold
	in the victim. They all possess the capability to use magic.

	But on its heels ere the sunset faded, there came a second
	apparition, striding with incredible strides and halting when
	it loomed almost upon me in the red twilight-the monstrous mummy
	of some ancient king still crowned with untarnished gold but
	turning to my gaze a visage that more than time or the worm had
	wasted. Broken swathings flapped about the skeleton legs, and
	above the crown that was set with sapphires and orange rubies, a
	black something swayed and nodded horribly; but, for an instant,
	I did not dream what it was.  Then, in its middle, two oblique
	and scarlet eyes opened and glowed like hellish coals, and two
	ophidian fangs glittered in an ape-like mouth.  A squat, furless,
	shapeless head on a neck of disproportionate extent leaned
	unspeakably down and whispered in the mummy's ear. Then, with
	one stride, the titanic lich took half the distance between us,
	and from out the folds of the tattered sere-cloth a gaunt arm
	arose, and fleshless, taloned fingers laden with glowering gems,
	reached out and fumbled for my throat . . .

	The chamber was of unhewn rock, round, as near as might
	be, eighteen or twenty feet across, and gay with rich

	moss was in abundant life, some feathering, and some
	gobleted, and some with fringe of red to it.

	Legend has it that there was once an ambitious king who wanted

	out to fulfill the wishes of the king by capturing an ancient
	vampire and transferring its essence into a fearsome two-handed
	sword.  The king tested the powers of the blade on the wizard
	that created it, then used it to conquer his enemies, and finally
	all within his reach.  The legend goes on to say that the king
	became so consumed with using the power of the sword that he
	completely succumbed to it, and became a vampire himself...

	before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after
	them shall be such.  For they covered the face of the whole earth,
	so that the land was darkened; and they did eat every herb of the

	there remained not any green thing in the trees, or in the herbs

	darkened by the smoke from the Abyss.  And out of the smoke locusts
	came down on the earth and were given power like that of scorpions
	of the earth.  They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or
	any plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal
	of God on their foreheads.  They were not allowed to kill them but
	only to torture them for five months.  And the agony they suffered
	was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes.  During

looking glass
mirror
	Nymphs are often seen with mirrors, and have a 50% chance of being
	generated with one.

	Applying a mirror to a monster can scare it; this only works if
	they can see it, i.e. they are not eyeless or blind, and you must
	not be invisible (unless the monster can also see invisible).
	There is an 80% chance of the foe fleeing for 2d4 turns, unless
	one of the special cases below occurs. Humanoid foes and
	unicorns are not fooled by a mirror and won't be frightened. A
	cursed mirror only works half the time; the rest of the time it
	will "fog up" instead.

	Applying a mirror to a nymph or a foocubus (a succubus in 3.4.3)
	will not scare them; instead, the monster will steal the mirror
	and teleport away.

	Breaking a mirror gives a −2 penalty to Luck. Hitting a monster
	with a wielded mirror will cause it to break and deal one point
	of damage; this damage also applies to shades, though this is not
	particularly useful.

	When Perseus was grown up Polydectes sent him to attempt the
	conquest of Medusa, a terrible monster who had laid waste the
	country.  She was once a beautiful maiden whose hair was her
	chief glory, but as she dared to vie in beauty with Minerva,
	the goddess deprived her of her charms and changed her
	beautiful ringlets into hissing serpents.  She became a cruel
	monster of so frightful an aspect that no living thing could
	behold her without being turned into stone.  All around the
	cavern where she dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men
	and animals which had chanced to catch a glimpse of her and
	had been petrified with the sight.  Perseus, favoured by
	Minerva and Mercury, the former of whom lent him her shield
	and the latter his winged shoes, approached Medusa while she

	by her image reflected in the bright shield which he bore, he
	cut off her head and gave it to Minerva, who fixed it in the
	middle of her Aegis.

melon
	"What is it, Umbopa, son of a fool?" I shouted in Zulu.
	"It is food and water, Macumazahn," and again he waved the
	green thing.
	Then I saw what he had got.  It was a melon.  We had hit upon
	a patch of wild melons, thousands of them, and dead ripe.
	"Melons!" I yelled to Good, who was next me; and in another
	second he had his false teeth fixed in one.
	I think we ate about six each before we had done, and, poor
	fruit as they were, I doubt if I ever thought anything nicer.

mephisto*
	This diabolical fiend has crimson skin, massive red leathery
	wings, curling horns, white eyes, and long, straight black
	hair.  Swathed in a flowing black cape, he is the vision of
	evil.

mercury
	Roman god of commerce, trade and travellers.  He is commonly
	depicted carrying a caduceus (a staff with two snakes
	intertwining around it) and a purse.
migo*
mi-go*
	These strange beings are visitors from another realm.  An
	unusual symbiotic relationship exists between the intelligent
	fungus and the insectoid form that comprises the bulk of its
	body.  They are said to have access to great magical powers.
	Their queens have been known to steal human brains, taking
	them back to distant Yuggoth.
	Migo are also known as the Fungi from Yuggoth.

mermaid
	A tail is far from the only thing preventing a human from

*mimic
	The ancestors of the modern day chameleon, these creatures can
	assume the form of anything in their surroundings.  They may
	assume the shape of objects or dungeon features.  Unlike the
	chameleon though, which assumes the shape of another creature
	and goes in hunt of food, the mimic waits patiently for its
	meals to come in search of it.
illithid
~mind flayer larva
*mind flayer
	This creature has a humanoid body, tentacles around its
	covered mouth, and three long fingers on each hand.  Mind
	flayers are telepathic, and love to devour intelligent beings,
	especially humans.  If they hit their victim with a tentacle,
	the mind flayer will slowly drain it of all intelligence,
	eventually killing its victim.
mind flayer larva
	Mind flayer larva are only ever found in mind flayer nurseries,
	tended to by an adult mind flayer.  Relatively weak, they exist
	in shallow pools of water and will not venture from them.  They
	have one attack, which is to attempt to attach itself to its
	victims face.  If successful, the victim has only moments to kill
	or remove the mind flayer larva from its face.  If not removed in
	time, the mind flayer larva burrows itself into its victims brain,
	killing them instantly.  The larva controls the host body, feeding
	off of it and eventually growing into a full-grown mind flayer.
mine*
gnomish mines
	Made by Dwarfs.  The Rule here is that the Mine is either long
	deserted or at most is inhabited by a few survivors who will
	make confused claims to have been driven out/decimated by humans/
	other Dwarfs/Minions of the Dark Lord.  Inhabited or not, this
	Mine will be very complex, with many levels of galleries,
	beautifully carved and engineered.  What was being mined here
	is not always evident, but at least some of the time it will
	appear to have been Jewels, since it is customary to find
	unwanted emeralds, etc., still embedded in the rock of the
	walls.  Metal will also be present, but only when made up into
	armor and weapons (_wondrous_).
		[ The Tough Guide to Fantasyland, by Diana Wynne Jones ]
*minotaur
	The Minotaur was a monster, half bull, half human, the
	offspring of Minos' wife Pasiphae and a wonderfully beautiful
	bull. ...  When the Minotaur was born Minos did not kill him.
	He had Daedalus, a great architect and inventor, construct a
	place of confinement for him from which escape was impossible.
	Daedalus built the Labyrinth, famous throughout the world.
	Once inside, one would go endlessly along its twisting paths
	without ever finding the exit.
		[ Mythology, by Edith Hamilton ]
mit*ra*
	Originating in India (Mitra), Mithra is a god of light who
	was translated into the attendant of the god Ahura Mazda in
	the light religion of Persia; from this he was adopted as
	the Roman deity Mithras.  He is not generally regarded as a
	sky god but a personification of the fertilizing power of
	warm, light air.  According to the _Avesta_, he possesses
	10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
	horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
	the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he
	represents truth.  He is responsible for the keeping of oaths
	and contracts.  He is attributed with the creation of both
	plants and animals.  His chief adversary is Ahriman, the
	power of darkness.
		[ The Encyclopaedia of Myths and Legends of All Nations,
		  by Herbert Spencer Robinson and Knox Wilson ]
*mithril*
	_Mithril_!  All folk desired it.  It could be beaten like
	copper, and polished like glass; and the Dwarves could make
	of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered steel.
	Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the beauty
	of _mithril_ did not tarnish or grow dim.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
*mitre of holiness
	This helm of brilliance performs all of the normal functions
	of a helm of brilliance, but also has the ability to protect
	anyone who carries it from fire.  When invoked, it boosts
	the energy of the invoker, allowing them to cast more spells.
mjollnir
	Forged by the dwarves Eitri and Brokk, in response to Loki's
	challenge, Mjollnir is an indestructible war hammer.  It has
	two magical properties:  when thrown it always returned to
	Thor's hand; and it could be made to shrink in size until it
	could fit inside Thor's shirt.  Its only flaw is that it has
	a short handle.  The other gods judged Mjollnir the winner of
	the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had
	the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends
	surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of
	"vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births,
	weddings, and even to raise his goats from the dead.  In the
	Norse mythologies Mjollnir is considered to represent Thor's
	governance over the entire cycle of life - fertility, birth,
	destruction, and resurrection.
mog
	Mog is known as the Spider God.  Mog resembles a four-limbed
	spider with a handsome, if not entirely human, face.
~slime mold
*mold
*moldier
	Mold, multicellular organism of the division Fungi, typified
	by plant bodies composed of a network of cottony filaments.
	The colors of molds are due to spores borne on the filaments.
	Most molds are saprophytes.  Some species (e.g., penicillium)
	are used in making cheese and antibiotics.
		[ The Concise Columbia Encyclopedia ]
* mold warrior
	In rare cases, patches of mold have gained intelligence and
	autonomy. They then use corpses for raw material in order to
	propogate and grow.
mol?ch
	And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
	Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever
	he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that
	sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech;
	he shall surely be put to death: the people of the land shall
	stone him with stones.
	And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
	from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
	Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
	And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes
	from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill
	him not:
	Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
	family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after
	him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
		[ Leviticus 20:1-5 ]
moradin
	Moradin is the creator, the ancestral father of the dwarven race.
	He is an excellent craftsman and warrior, as befits the respected
	leader of the dwarven pantheon, and is a master of the forge.  He
	is pictured as a tall, muscular dwarf, wearing rough blacksmith's
	clothing.  In most representations of him, he is at the forge,
	working on a piece of steel.  As could be expected, his symbol of
	worship is the anvil and hammer.
mongbat
	In appearance, a cross between a small boy and a bat, this nimble
	creature is capable of quick, aerial strikes. Fortunately, a
	mongbat's small size renders its attack little more than a painful
	nuisance.
		[ Beyond the Serpent Pillars by Andrew Morris ]

	Though a novice, the warrior had riches.
	In finery, he assaulted the liches.
	  An orc got his suit,
	  A spectre one boot,
	And a mongbat is wearing his britches.

monkey
lemur
	"Listen, man-cub," said the Bear, and his voice rumbled like
	thunder on a hot night.  "I have taught thee all the Law of
	the Jungle for all the peoples of the jungle--except the
	Monkey-Folk who live in the trees.  They have no law.  They
	are outcasts.  They have no speech of their own, but use the
	stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,
	and wait up above in the branches.  Their way is not our way.
	They are without leaders.  They have no remembrance.  They
	boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people
	about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of
	a nut turns their minds to laughter and all is forgotten.
	We of the jungle have no dealings with them.  We do not drink
	where the monkeys drink; we do not go where the monkeys go;
	we do not hunt where they hunt; we do not die where they die...."
		[ The Jungle Book, by Rudyard Kipling ]
*morning star
	The morning star was a medieval weapon resembling a mace, but
	with a large spike on the end and smaller spikes around the
	circumference.  It was also known as the goedendag (from the
	Dutch word for "good day") and the holy water sprinkler (from
	its resemblance to the aspergillum sometimes used in the
	Catholic Mass).  It was used by both cavalry and infantry;
	the horseman's weapon typically had a shorter haft than the
	footman's, which might be up to six feet long.  It came into
	use in the beginning of the 14th century.
	The name "morning star" is often erroneously applied to the
	military flail (also known as the therscol), a similar weapon,
	but with the head attached by a short chain.

*mosquito
	Red Saunders said he could take anything.  The men found a corner
	of the island where thick clouds of mosquitos were hovering above
	the still water.  The workmen built a small, smoldering fire to
	give off smoke that would give them some shelter.  And Red stripped
	off his shirt and lay face down in the mud, letting the mosquitoes
	go to work on his back.  And work they did.  Red's back was soon
	covered with the insects, digging in, drawing blood, and leaving
	itchy welts behind.  But Red didn't flinch.  He just lay there,
	letting the mosquitos feed on him, and only occasionally looking up
	to say "I sure hope those mosquitos over there ain't getting to be
	too much for y'all" to the men sheltering in the smoke.  This went
	on and on.  But when about three-quarters of that hour had passed,
	something happened.  Red felt something bite into his back sharper
	and more powerful than he had ever imagined.  A searing, sharp pain,
	bit into his flesh, and he heard one of the men by the fire yell out
	"Gallinipper!"
		[ The Legend of the Gallinipper,
		  Averasboro, North Carolina, circa. 1855 ]

	There are in this country over thirty varieties of mosquitoes.
	Some are small and others are quite large.  Some live wholly on
	vegetable juices, while others have a passion for animal fluids.
	The largest, and perhaps the most ferocious kind, is one which the
	steamboatmen of the Mississippi River call the galnipper.  Of it
	they tell strange stories.  They describe it as being as large as a
	goose; and they gravely declare that it flies about at night with a
	brick-bat under its wings to sharpen its beak with.
		[ Living Creatures of Water, Land and Air, by John Monteith ]
mumak*
	... the Mumak of Harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and
	the like of him does not walk now in Middle-Earth; his kin
	that live still in latter days are but memories of his girth
	and majesty.  On he came, ... his great legs like trees,
	enormous sail-like ears spread out, long snout upraised like
	a huge serpent about to strike, his small red eyes raging.
	His upturned hornlike tusks ... dripped with blood.
		[ The Two Towers, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
*mummy
	But for an account of the manner in which the body was
	bandaged, and a list of the unguents and other materials
	employed in the process, and the words of power which were
	spoken as each bandage was laid in its place, we must have
	recourse to a very interesting papyrus which has been edited
	and translated by M. Maspero under the title of Le Rituel de
	l'Embaumement. ...
	Everything that could be done to preserve the body was now
	done, and every member of it was, by means of the words of
	power which changed perishable substances into imperishable,
	protected to all eternity; when the final covering of purple
	or white linen had been fastened upon it, the body was ready
	for the tomb.

	He held a white cloth -- it was a serviette he had brought
	with him -- over the lower part of his face, so that his
	mouth and jaws were completely hidden, and that was the
	reason for his muffled voice.  But it was not that which
	startled Mrs. Hall.  It was the fact that all his forehead
	above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and
	that another covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his
	face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.  It was
	bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first.  He
	wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-
	lined collar turned up about his neck.  The thick black
	hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross
	bandages, project in curious tails and horns, giving him
	the strangest appearance conceivable.

*naga*
*naja*
	The naga is a mystical creature with the body of a snake and
	the head of a man or woman.  They will fiercely protect the
	territory they consider their own.  Some nagas can be forced
	to serve as guardians by a spellcaster of great power.
naginata
	A Japanese pole-arm, fitted with a curved single-edged blade.
	The blades ranged in length from two to four feet, mounted on
	shafts about four to five feet long.  The naginata were cut
	with a series of short grooves near to the tang, above which
	the back edge was thinned, but not sharpened, so that the
	greater part of the blade was a flattened diamond shape in
	section.  Seen in profile, the curve is slight or non-
	existent near the tang, becoming more pronounced towards the
	point.
		[]

	"With his naginata he killed five, but with the sixth it
	snapped asunder in the midst and, flinging it away, he drew
	his sword, wielding it in the zigzag style, the interlacing,
	cross, reversed dragonfly, waterwheel, and eight-sides-at-
	once styles of fencing and cutting down eight men; but as he
	brought down the ninth with a mighty blow on the helmet, the
	blade snapped at the hilt."

nalfeshnee
	Not only do these demons do physical damage with their claws

nalzok
	Nalzok is Moloch's cunning and unfailingly loyal battle
	lieutenant, to whom he trusts the command of warfare when he
	does not wish to exercise it himself.  Nalzok is a major
	demon, known to command the undead.  He is hungry for power,
	and secretly covets Moloch's position.  Moloch doesn't trust
	him, but, trusting his own power enough, chooses to allow
	Nalzok his position because he is useful.
neferet
neferet the green
	Neferet the Green holds office in her hidden tower, only
	reachable by magical means, where she teaches her apprentices
	the enigmatic skills of occultism.  Despite her many years, she
	continues to investigate new spells, especially those involving
	translocation.  It is further rumored that when she was an
	apprentice herself, she accidentally turned her skin green, and
	has kept it that way ever since.
neothelid
	Neothelids are extremely rare creatures, so called as they were
	illithid larvae who had undergone neoteny.  They typically
	appeared once a mind flayer society was destroyed and the larva
	nursery left unsupervised.  The larval illithids engaged in
	cannibalism until the last survivor became a gargantuan leviathan
	loathed by all, especially mind flayers themselves.  Neothelids
	are slime-covered worms with a quadri-tentacled mouth that resembled
	gigantic versions of illithid larvae.  They were often mistaken for
	purple worms due to their purple skin, and massive larval body
	structure.

	each other, bat wings whose beating made no sound, ugly prehensile
	paws, and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly.
	And worst of all, they never spoke or laughed, and never smiled
	because they had no faces at all to smile with, but only a suggestive
	blankness where a face ought to be. All they ever did was clutch
	and fly and tickle; that was the way of night-gaunts.

	Verdandi, and Skuld, representing the past, the present, and
	the future.  Urda and Verdandi were kindly disposed, but Skuld
	was cruel and savage.  Their tasks were to sew the web of
	fate, to water the sacred ash, Yggdrasil, and to keep it in
	good condition by placing fresh earth around it daily.  In her

	one theory purports that it was developed from a horse's bit.
	Chinese nunchaku tend to be rounded, whereas Japanese are
	octagonal, and they were originally linked by horse hair.
	There are many variations on the nunchaku, ranging from the
	three sectional staff (san-setsu-kon nunchaku), to smaller

	long, thick hair, radiant skin and perfect teeth, full lips
	and gentle eyes.  A nymph's scent is delightful, and her
	long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroidered
	with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence.  A nymph's
	demeanour is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty.
		[]

	Theseus felt her voice pulling him down into fathoms of

	pain.  There was fear.	But his head was in the nymph's lap
	and her musk was about him, her voice weaving the dream.  He
	knew then that she had been sent to tell him of something
	dreadful that was to happen to him later.  Her song was a
	warning.  But she had brought him a new kind of joy, one that
	made him see everything differently.  The boy, who was to
	become a hero, suddenly knew then what most heroes learn
	later -- and some too late -- that joy blots suffering and
	that the road to nymphs is beset by monsters.

obsidian*
	A volcanic glass, homogeneous in texture and having a low water
	content, with a vitreous luster and a conchoidal fracture.  The
	color is commonly black, but may be some shade of red or brown,
	and cut sections sometimes appear to be green.  Like other
	volcanic glasses, obsidian is a lava that has cooled too quickly
	for the contained minerals to crystallize.  In chemical
	composition it is rich in silica and similar to granite.  It is
	favored by primitive peoples for knives, arrowheads, spearheads,
	and other weapons and tools.

ochre jelly
	This monster resembles a giant amoeba, seeping through darkened

	cellulose to devour. ... Voraciously dissolving all types of carrion
	and trash, this monster is sometimes tolerated in inhabited subterranean
	areas for its janitorial services, but this activity is difficult to
	organize and is usually not appreciated by the inhabitants because of
	its danger.

odin
	Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
	the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
	god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
	warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
	the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
	As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
	footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
	accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
	use as his spies.
	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
ogre*
	Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
	easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
	Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
	metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
	Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
	Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
	skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
	with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
	would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
	Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
	a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
	carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
	not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
	orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
	meal.

oilskin sack
    The oilskin sack can hold items beyond the 52-character limit,
    much like the regular sack, with the exception that a noncursed
    oilskin sack will also protect its contents from becoming wet. A
    cursed oilskin sack only protects its contents two-thirds of the
    time.

    Oilskin sacks can be identified from the other types of bag by
    dipping them into a water source; this will produce the message
    "Some water slides right off the bag."

	but the Olog-hai were in fashion of body and mind quite unlike
	even the largest of Orc-kind, whom they far surpassed in size
	and power.  Trolls they were, but filled with the evil will
	of their master:  a fell race, strong, agile, fierce and

orion
sirius
	Orion was the son of Neptune. He was a handsome giant and a
	mighty hunter. His father gave him the power of wading
	through the depths of the sea, or, as others say, of
	walking on its surface.

	He dwelt as a hunter with Diana (Artemis), with whom he
	was a favourite, and it is even said she was about to marry
	him. Her brother was highly displeased and often chid her,
	but to no purpose. One day, observing Orion wading through
	the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed
	it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit
	that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess discharged
	a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
	Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many
	tears, Diana placed him among the stars, where he appears
	as a giant, with a girdle, sword, lion's skin, and

pick*ax*
broad pick
dwarvish mattock
	While classified as a tool and designed for digging, it can also
	be used as a weapon - the dwarvish mattock is a similar weapon-
	tool primarily classified as a weapon.

	The pick-axe and the dwarvish mattock use the pick-axe skill.
	You can apply a pick-axe to tunnel through walls or the floor, dig
	through doors and smash boulders and statues. If you apply it
	upward, a rock will fall from the ceiling and bonk you on the head.
	If you have the autodig option enabled and are currently wielding
	a pick-axe, you can dig into walls or the ground by simply walking
	into them (or pressing >); this does not work for boulders, statues,
	or doors. You can dig faster by enchanting the pick-axe, playing
	as a dwarf and/or using other available methods - somewhat
	unusually,your skill level in pick-axe has no bearing on your
	digging speed.

	Attacking with a pick-axe gives a +2 to-hit bonus against xorns.

	Shopkeepers will attempt to block off the entrance of their shops
	if you have a pick-axe in your inventory. You can drop it at the
	entrance to the shop (not counting the doorway), place it into a
	container, or try to force your way in by moving behind another
	monster. Trying to throw a pick-axe in diagonally will cause the
	shopkeeper to swiftly catch it; pulling out a pick-axe from a
	container you are carrying while already in the shop will cause the
	shopkeeper to yell at you - there is no other effect, however, and
	you can continue to shop as normal. Digging a pit in the floor will
	have them warn you about falling through; the real danger is that
	if you make the pit into a hole, objects on that square and adjacent
	squares can fall through the hole - this counts as theft and will
	anger the shopkeeper.

	Watchmen do not appreciate you digging up the level on their watch,
	and will warn you if they see you trying to dig through doors or
	walls with a pick-axe. Continuing immediately after being warned
	will cause those watchmen to become hostile.

	Note: Pickaxes are now quite loud when used to chop down doors.

	The mine is full of holes;
	With the wound of pickaxes.

		[ Divan-i Kebir Meter 2, by Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi ]

	A mattock is an agricultural tool similar to a mining pick.
	It is distinguished by the head terminating in a broader blade
	rather than a narrow spike, which makes it particularly suitable
	for breaking up moderately hard ground. ... During the Middle
	Ages of Europe, the mattock served as an improvised shafted
	weapon for the poorer classes.

    When worn, if you lack poison resistance, the cloak delivers a
    poisoned attack with a 1 in 3 chance of being fatal, otherwise
    doing normal strength/hp damage and identifying the cloak. If you
    have poison resistance, the cloak has no effect, but gives the
    message "This cloak feels a little itchy." Although this
    unambiguously identifies the cloak, it does not actually self-
    identify in this case.

    While worn, you will be prevented from regenerating.

    Usually generates cursed.
poseido*n
	Poseido(o)n, lord of the seas and father of rivers and
	fountains, was the son of Chronos and Rhea, brother of Zeus,
	Hades, Hera, Hestia and Demeter.  His rank of ruler of the
	waves he received by lot at the Council Meeting of the Gods,
	at which Zeus took the upper world for himself and gave
	dominion over the lower world to Hades.
	Poseidon is associated in many ways with horses and thus is
	the god of horses.  He taught men how to ride and manage the
	animal he invented and is looked upon as the originator and
	guardian deity of horse races.
	His symbol is the familiar trident or three-pronged spear
	with which he can split rocks, cause or quell storms, and
	shake the earth, a power which makes him the god of
	earthquakes as well.  Physically, he is shown as a strong and
	powerful ruler, every inch a king.

	Get thee hence, nor come again,
	Mix not memory with doubt,
	Pass, thou deathlike type of pain,
	Pass and cease to move about!
	'Tis the blot upon the brain
	That will show itself without.
		...
	For, Maud, so tender and true,
	As long as my life endures
	I feel I shall owe you a debt,
	That I never can hope to pay;
	And if ever I should forget
	That I owe this debt to you
	And for your sweet sake to yours;
	O then, what then shall I say? -
	If ever I should forget,
	May God make me more wretched
	Than ever I have been yet!

    On waking, he found himself on the green knoll whence he had
    first seen the old man of the glen.  He rubbed his eyes -- it
    was a bright sunny morning.  The birds were hopping and
    twittering among the bushes, and the eagle was wheeling aloft,
    and breasting the pure mountain breeze.  "Surely," thought Rip,
    "I have not slept here all night."  He recalled the occurrences
    before he fell asleep.  The strange man with a keg of liquor --
    the mountain ravine -- the wild retreat among the rocks -- the
    woe-begone party at ninepins -- the flagon -- "Oh! that flagon!
    that wicked flagon!" thought Rip -- "what excuse shall I make
    to Dame Van Winkle!"

milky potion

	  take each game. It is noteworthy because it has a chance of
	  summoning a ghost upon quaffing. If the monster appears, the
	  potion does not have its normal effect.

	- Milky potions have a chance of containing a hostile ghost;
	  unless you are blind when you quaff the milky potion, you
	  will be frightened and unable to move for 3 turns. The
	  probability of a milky potion generating a ghost is based
	  on the number of ghosts already generated by any means:
	  1 in (13 + 2n), where n is the number of ghosts already
	  generated. Since there will always be a large number of
	  ghosts in the Valley of the Dead, the chance of getting a
	  ghost from a potion decreases significantly after that point.

	- A monster quaffing a milky potion can also summon a ghost,
	paralyzing them for 3 turns.
potion of monster detection
    When quaffed, this potion shows all monsters on the current

      paralyzed monsters on the level.

potion of oil
	The potion of oil is primarily a source of fuel for lamps and
	lanterns but has a number of other uses.

	Dipping:
	- Dipping a unicorn horn into a potion of oil just identifies
	  and uses up the potion, no further effects.
	- Dipping anything into a lit potion of oil consumes it and will
	  burn the dipped item(s) if possible.
	- Dipping a rusty or corroded weapon into a non-cursed potion of
	  oil removes one degree of damage.
	- Oil is undilutable.

	To refuel: Dip the lamp into the potion of oil, which consumes
	it. If the lamp is lit and the potion is not, the potion will
	explode.

	- Doing anything with a cursed potion of oil may cause the oil
	  to spill and make your fingers slippery.

	Lighting:
	- (a)pply the potion to light it or snuff it out; this also
	  auto-identifies the potion.
	- A lit potion of oil can be thrown as an explosive projectile,
	  dealing 4d4 fire damage to anything caught in the explosion.

    Quaffing:
	- When an unlit potion is quaffed, this abuses your Wisdom and
	  identifies the potion.
	- Quaffing a lit potion additionally deals 3d4 fire damage
	  (1d4 if fire resistant). However, if you are polymorphed into
	  a monster that likes fire, you instead exercise wisdom and
	  take no damage.

	- A potion of oil can be used to untrap a squeaky board,
	  similar to a can of grease.

	- Dipping an item into this potion may polymorph the item.

	- Cancelled potions of sickness turn into fruit juice.
	- Dipping a unicorn horn into sickness also converts it to
	  fruit juice.
	- Dipping a stack of fruit juice into a sickness will
	  'contaminate' the stack, turning them into potions of sickness.

smoky potion
	- smoky is one of the randomized appearances that a potion can
	  take each game. It is noteworthy because it has a chance of
	  summoning a djinni upon quaffing. If the monster appears, the
	  potion does not have its normal effect.

	- Quaffing a smoky potion has a 1 in (13 + 2n) chance of
	  producing a djinni, where n is the number of djinn that have
	  been created in this game. This djinni might grant you a wish,
	  become tame, be peaceful, vanish instantly, or turn hostile;
	  the chances of each outcome depend on the beatitude of the
	  potion and are identical to the chances for magic lamps.
	  Blessed smoky potions are the most likely to give a wish.

	- The effect of quaffing a smoky potion does not depend on
	  whether or not you have identified that type of potion. If you
	  have identified smoky potions but have forgotten which ones
	  they are, you can use \ or ` to check your current discoveries.

	- Djinn can also be summoned when a monster quaffs a smoky potion.
	  The djinni will disappear 50% of the time; the other 50% it will
	  be peaceful. In neither case will it grant wishes, though it
	  does count toward the total number of djinn created.

    Alchemy recipes:
    - Potions of vampire blood can be made via alchemy by dipping
      vampire blood into potions of fruit juice.
potion of water
    Potions of water act as water - a mostly neutral item, but
    capable of powerful manipulations.

	- Quaffing an uncursed potion of water gives you d10 nutrition.

	Creating:
	- Potions of water can be created by diluting any potion
	  (except acid) twice in a fountain or body of water such as a pool.
	- Water produced this way will always be uncursed.
	- Dipping unicorn horns into potions of confusion, hallucination,
	  blindness, or blood will convert the potion to water.

	- Changing the BUC of an uncursed potion of water can create a
	  potion of holy water or unholy water.

*pseudodragon
        Pseudodragons are small, magical, flying lizards native to
        wilderness forests but occasionally found as companions to humans,
        particularly wizards.  They look much like tiny red dragons,
        except for the long, barbed tail and slightly brownish coloration.
        Their coloration is subject to frequent change, however, as they
        can alter their color to blend in to their forest homes.  They are
        omnivorous, eating rodents and birds along with leaves and fruits.

ptah
	Known under various names (Nu, Neph, Cenubis, Amen-Kneph,
	Khery-Bakef), Ptah is the creator god and god of craftsmen.
	He is usually depicted as wearing a closely fitting robe
	with only his hands free.  His most distinctive features are
	the invariable skull-cap exposing only his face and ears,
	and the _was_ or rod of domination which he holds,
	consisting of a staff surmounted by the _ankh_ symbol of
	life.  He is otherwise symbolized by his sacred animal, the

*purple worm
	A gargantuan version of the harmless rain-worm, the purple
	worm poses a huge threat to the ordinary adventurer.  It is
	known to swallow whole and digest its victims within only a

	to the most minute vibrations in the earth, but may also
	be awakened by a remote shriek.
pyrolisk
	At first glance around the corner, I thought it was another
	cockatrice. I had encountered the wretched creatures two or
	three times since leaving the open area. I quickly ducked my
	head back and considered what to do next. My heart had begun
	to thump audibly as I patted my pack to make sure I still had
	the dead lizards at close reach. A check of my attire showed
	no obvious holes or damage. I had to keep moving. One deep
	breath, and a count of three, two, one, and around the corner
	I bolted. But it was no cockatrice! I felt a sudden intense
	searing of the skin around my face, and flames began to leap
	from my pack. I tossed it to the ground, and quickly retreated
	back, around that corner, desperately striving to get out of
	its sight.
python
	A monstrous serpent in Greek mythology, and the child of Gaia,

	It lived in a cave and guarded the oracle of Delphi on mount
	Parnassus.

	No man dared to approach the beast and the people asked Apollo
	for help.  He came down from Mount Olympus with his silver bow
	and golden arrows.  With using only one arrow he killed the
	serpent and claimed the oracle for himself. ... The old name of
	Delphi, Pytho, refers to the serpent.

	in order to locate a particle exactly, an observer must be
	able to bounce off it a photon of radiation; this act of
	location itself alters the position of the particle
	in an unpredictable way.  To locate the position accurately,
	photons of short wavelength would have to be used.  The high
	momentum of such photons would cause a large effect on the
	position.  On the other hand, using photons of lower momenta
	would have less effect on the particle's position, but would
	be less accurate because of the lower wavelength.

	deflection includes the trapping of opponent weapons in the space
	below the main blade, where a twist of the shaft would apply
	pressure from it or the secondary projections to either break the
	caught weapon or disarm its wielder. Additionally, the side
	projections provide both a means of holding an opponent at long
	range or of pulling mounted opponents off their steed.

ring of adornment
	Modifies your charisma. The change in charisma is equal to the
	ring's enchantment; the enchantment can be altered by charging.
	Succubi will steal or ask for rings of adornment.
ring of gain constitution
	Modifies your constitution. The change in constituion is equal
	to the ring's enchantment; the enchantment can be altered by
	charging. The boost to constitution exceeds racial limitations
	up to a maximum of 25.
ring of gain dexterity
	 Modifies your dexterity. The change in dexterity is equal to the
	 ring's enchantment; the enchantment can be altered by charging.
ring of gain intelligence
	 Modifies your intelligence. The change in intelligence is equal
	 to the ring's enchantment; the enchantment can be altered by
	 charging.
ring of gain strength
	A ring of gain strength increases your strength by its enchantment,
	which can be altered by charging. At 18 strength, the ring will
	instead increase percentile dice by its enchantment.
ring of gain wisdom
	A ring of gain wisdom increases your wisdom by its enchantment,
	which can be altered by charging.
ring of increase accuracy
	A ring of increase accuracy adds its enchantment to your to-hit
	rolls. The enchantment can be altered by charging. Like the ring
	of increase damage, it can be eaten for a chance at obtaining an
	intrinsic accuracy bonus provided it is of an edible material.
ring of increase damage
	A ring of increase damage adds its enchantment to your damage
	rolls. The enchantment can be altered by charging. This does not
	affect damage you deal with spells. The effect stacks if you wear
	two of them.
	If the ring is of an edible material, it may be possible to eat it
	to permanently gain a damage bonus.
ring of protection
	A ring of protection also increases your magic cancellation by 1,
	to a maximum of 3. This does not depend on its enchantment, and
	it does not stack with a second ring of protection.
	The enchantment can be altered by charging.

	Eating a ring of protection with non-zero enchantment has a chance
	of conferring intrinsic protection.
ring of regeneration
	While wearing it, you heal more quickly. While you are healing you
	will burn more nutrition, but when at full health the ring will
	stop using up nutrition.
	Regeneration causes you to heal one HP on any turn you would
	otherwise heal none. Regeneration is not cumulative, so wearing
	two such rings, or a ring along with another regeneration source,
	grants no further benefit.
ring of searching
	Grants you the automatic searching extrinsic, which automatically
	searches the squares around you at the end of each turn.

	Eating a ring of searching can give the automatic searching
	intrinsic.
ring of stealth
	Wearing a ring of stealth gives you extrinsic stealth.

	Polymorphing and eating the ring may grant you stealth as an
	intrinsic.
ring of sustain ability
	When worn, it prevents the wearer's base attributes from being
	changed in any way, except by polymorphing into your own race.
	This includes stat increase through exercise, as well as stat
	loss from abuse.
ring of levitation
	Wearing a ring of levitation causes you to levitate.
	While you are levitating, you will float over some otherwise
	hazardous terrain and traps, but you will not be able to touch
	the ground to pick up items.

	Levitating over a sink removes any sources of levitation and
	causes you to crash to the ground; this can be useful in removing
	a cursed ring of levitation, or a ring of levitation under cursed
	gloves.
ring of hunger
	Wearing a ring of hunger conveys the hunger extrinsic, which
	causes you to burn nutrition very quickly; every even-numbered
	turn your nutrition is decremented. It is usually generated
	cursed.
ring of aggravate monster
	Dropping a ring of hunger into a sink produces the message,
	"Suddenly, <item> vanishes from the sink!" but only if there's
	another item on the sink. This auto-identifies the ring.
	Otherwise, "You hear the ring bouncing down the drain pipe."
ring of conflict
	Wearing the ring will generate conflict, causing all monsters
	within line of sight and a radius of eight squares to attack the
	nearest monster, including you; monsters may resist this effect
	dependent on level and monster magic resistance. Every even-
	numbered turn you wear the ring, your nutrition is decremented by
	1.

	Conflict now takes the players charisma score into account. The
	formula is 'charisma - monster level + player level' and if that
	value is greater than 19, clamps it to be 19. There's then a
	percentage chance (rnd(20)) against the value generated on
	whether conflict kicks in or not. So even with charisma and your
	xp level maxed out, there's still a 5% chance of conflict not
	working. Also, the monsters affected have to see you for conflict
	to work.
ring of warning
	Wearing a ring of warning gives you the warning property. The
	warning will cause monsters to be displayed as numbers (or
	colored question marks, if playing with tiles). Warning is a
	valuable property to have; while it does not explicitly reveal
	the identity of the creatures a la telepathy, it has a larger
	range than telepathy, and works while unblind unlike intrinsic
	telepathy. Telepathy also does not sense mindless creatures like
	undead, whereas warning works on all but monsters of level 3 or
	lower. However, several roles get warning intrinsically as they
	increase in level; for them, a ring of warning is obviously
	useless once they reach that point.

	Wooden or metal rings of warning can be eaten to acquire warning
	intrinsically.
ring of poison resistance
	Wearing a ring of poison resistance conveys extrinsic poison
	resistance.
ring of fire resistance
	Wearing a ring of fire resistance conveys extrinsic fire
	resistance. This will also protect your items from fire
	destruction.
ring of cold resistance
	Wearing a ring of cold resistance conveys extrinsic cold
	resistance. This will also protect your items from cold damage.
ring of psychic resistance
	Wearing a ring of psychic resistance conveys extrinsic psychic
	resistance, which protects you from mental and fear attacks.

	This protect you from:
	- the negative effects of scrolls and potions of amnesia
	- Fear attacks (banshees, eye of fear and flame)
	- Being "paralyzed" by fear when an enormous ghost appears in a
	  deserted temple.
	- Dragon roars
	- Spell of psionic wave
ring of sonic resistance
	Wearing a ring of sonic resistance conveys extrinsic sonic
	resistance. This will also protect your items from sonic
	destruction. It is also immune to sonic damage.
ring of shock resistance
	Wearing a ring of shock resistance conveys extrinsic shock
	resistance. Unlike other rings, it is immune to electric damage
ring of free action
	Wearing a ring of free action gives you the free action extrinsic,
	which protects you from paralysis.

	Free action includes protection from:
    - Paralysis container traps
    - A thrown or quaffed potion of paralysis or potion of sleeping
    - Paralysis or stunning spells (reduced to one turn)

	In addition, protection from the paralyzing attacks of the following monsters:

	-Floating eyes passive attack
	-Gelatinous cubes, Ghouls, Guardian nagas, Shades, Yeenoghu, and others.

	Free action does not:
	- Protect you from being "paralyzed" by fear when an enormous
	  ghost appears in a deserted temple, or you chat to a skeleton
	- Protect you from sleep, except from potions of sleeping
	- Protect you from stunning, except from spells
	- Protect you from bear traps, pits, spider webs, or any
	  physically binding traps
	- Protect you from stoning
	- Allow you to move freely on the Plane of Air or Plane of Water
	- Prevent you from being incapacitated by lightning in clouds on
	  the Plane of Air
	- Grant any extra turns
	- Protect against helplessness caused by engraving, a cursed
	  spellbook, fumbling,[1] or hurtling through the air while
	  levitating.
	- Eating the ring will give you intrinsic sleep resistance
	  instead of free action.

	In Hack'EM, the ring does protect against grabbing attacks,
	including those of both drowning monsters and mind flayers, with
	a chance dependent on your Luck - 50% at 0 Luck, 90% when luck is
	maxed out.
ring of slow digestion
	When worn, the ring nullifies the ordinary consumption of one
	nutrition per turn. Nutrition consumption from all other sources,
	including the ring hunger from the ring itself, is unaffected;
	in practice, this means that a non-spellcasting player can go
	without being hungry twenty times longer than normal. Wearing
	two rings does not cause the effect to stack.

	If a monster attempts to engulf and digest you while you are
	wearing this ring, you will be expelled immediately (i.e. the
	ring slows your digestion).

	A cursed ring still has its effect.
ring of teleportation
	Wearing a ring of teleportation gives you teleportitis. These
	rings are often generated cursed.

	A cursed ring with a base price of 200 is very probably
	teleportation. To be sure, you can uncurse it and put it on -
	if ctrl + t gives "You cannot teleport at will" instead of
	"You don't know that spell", it is teleportation.

	The usefulness of teleportitis is rather schizophrenic;
	uncontrolled, it is usually considered a great annoyance, as you
	will often be teleported into danger (or worse, out of shops).
	Once the player gains teleport control, it is a great boon

	Dropping this ring down a sink will teleport the sink to a random
	location.
ring of teleport control
	Wearing a ring of teleport control conveys the teleport control
	extrinsic. This is an incredibly useful property, especially when
	combined with teleportitis or a means of level teleportation.
	Eating a ring of teleport control grants the property as an
	intrinsic.
ring of polymorph
	Wearing a ring of polymorph gives you polymorphitis, which has a
	1% chance of polymorphing you each turn. This ring is usually
	generated cursed, because uncontrolled polymorphitis can be
	frustrating. It can also cause system shock (unless you have
	control or are wearing dragon scales or dragon scale mail).

	If you have polymorph control, you may choose the form into which
	you polymorph. If you are inflicted with lycanthropy, the ring of
	polymorph will occasionally trigger a change into your normal
	form or the animal form of the werecreature that infected you.

	If you are wearing an amulet of unchanging, the ring of polymorph
	will have no effect (besides the usual ring hunger).

	Dropping the ring into a sink will polymorph the sink into one of
	altar, fountain, sink, grave, throne, or forge.
ring of polymorph control
	Grants polymorph control when worn. This allows you to choose what form you want to take when you polymorph.
	You will be asked "Become what type of monster? [type the name]".
	You can then choose to polymorph into a monster. Polymorph control
	will also allow you to decline a change in form brought upon by
	lycanthropy.

	Polymorphing into your own species will cause you to "feel like a
	new <species>!" and cause random change to your scores. There is a
	20% chance that this will happen in spite of polymorph control,
	even if a different monster is chosen.

	Polymorph control will not work if the player is stunned or
	unconscious. However, possessing polymorph control will always
	negate the possibility of system shock.

	Pay attention to the base level of the species, as this determines
	your resulting HP. If it is not enough to survive combat, you may
	need to increase it. This is only worthwhile if you plan to be
	unchanging, as the increase is lost when you transform back. You
	also regenerate HP at the same rate as your species, so having
	regeneration or healing magic is useful.

	When polymorphed into certain species, you can use their abilities
	with the #monster command:

	Females who polymorph into oviparous monsters can #sit to lay eggs,
	which hatch into pets of the same species.

	Most of your attributes are reset when you return to original form,
	but you keep any intrinsics gained while in monster form. For
	example, if you eat poisonous corpses that damage your strength,
	you may gain poison resistance and still keep your original
	strength when you change back.
ring of invisibility
ring of invisibl*
	Wearing a ring of invisibility makes you invisible.
	Nazgul will always leave a cursed ring of invisibility.

	"When time came for the shepherds to hold their customary
	assembly in order to prepare their monthly report to the king
	about the state of the flocks, he came too, wearing this ring.
	While he was sitting with the others, it chanced that he moved
	the collet of the ring around toward himself into the inside of
	his hand; having done this, he disappeared from the sight of
	those who were sitting beside him, and they discussed of him as
	of someone who had left.  And he wondered and once again feeling
	for the ring, he turned the collet outwards and, by turning it,
	reappeared.  Reflecting upon this, he put the ring to the test
	to see if it indeed had such power, and he came to this
	conclusion that, by turning the collet inwards, he became
	invisible, outwards, visible.  Having perceived this, he at
	once managed for himself to become one of the envoys to the
	king; upon arrival, having seduced his wife, with her help,
	he laid a hand on the king, murdered him and took hold of the
	leadership."
		[ The Republic, by Plato, translated by James Adam ]
ring of see invisible
	Wearing a ring of see invisible gives you see invisible, which lets
	you see creatures that are invisible.

	As invisible monsters are tricky to detect without other properties,
	this ring can be useful since permanent see invisible is no longer
	obtainable from potions of see invisible, fountain quaffing, or
	eating stalker corpses.
ring of protection from shape changers
	The ring of protection from shape changers can stop monsters from
	shapeshifting in certain situations.

	Some of the effects this ring has:
	- will uncloak mimics.
	- Chameleons, mimics, doppelgangers, sandestins and vampires
	  appear in their normal form.
	- Werecreatures appear in human form and thus cannot infect you
	  with lycanthropy. They are also prevented from summoning help.
	  However, if you have lycanthropy, wearing this ring will not
	  prevent you from transforming.
	- Monsters with a digestion attack will not polymorph when
	  swallowing a shapechanger whole. As a result, this ring is very
	  useful to anyone who wants pet purple worms but cannot (or
	  doesn't want to) genocide chameleons or doppelgangers. It will
	  not, however, protect pets that eat the corpses of these
	  monsters from polymorphing.
	- Wooden or metal rings of protection from shape changers can be
	  eaten to acquire protection from shape changers intrinsically.
mood ring
	 It has no effect when worn or eaten, but can be read for a clue
	 about your alignment.
	 To read a mood ring, you must be wearing it, it must not be
	 cursed, and you must not be blind. When read,
	 the ring will glow a different color depending on your alignment:

	Alignment   Color
	20+         Bright Green
	14-19       Green
	4-13        Yellow
	0-3         Orange
	negative    Red

	If cursed, the ring will only appear dark.
	If you are hallucinating, the ring will appear as random colors.
ring of sleeping
	 When worn, it causes you to randomly fall asleep for 1-20 turns
	 every 1-100 turns. This effect is permanent if the ring is eaten,
	 and negated if you have sleep resistance.
ring of p'hul
	Shandiph rose again; his knees were growing tired. "That's all
	right.  Yes, we already possess one; it was the Ring of P'hul
	that first permitted the Council of the Most High to gain what
	power we now hold, at the end of the Twelfth Age.  It has been
	kept carefully hidden ever since, because it is far too dangerous
	to use; it was the Ring which caused the Great Plague that wiped
	out the Royal Eramman Army and thereby put an end to the Racial
	Wars before the overmen could be wiped out.  It was the Ring that
	laid waste the Plain of Derbarok.  It always did what was asked
	of it, but never in the way desired; it ended the Racial Wars only
	by killing the army and ended the war with Orun only by ruining
	what both sides fought for."

robe
    Robes in Hack'EM are not like robes in vanilla NetHack. They are
    worn in the body armor slot, but do not interfere with, nor
    enhance (excepting the robe of power) spellcasting or a Monk's
    martial arts. They also provide MC 0 and AC 1, instead of MC 2
    and AC 2 in vanilla (The robe of protection is an exception in
    that it provides AC 5 and MC 1.)

    Robes can be grafted with dragon scales.

	Robes are the only garments, apart from Shirts, ever to have
	sleeves.  They have three uses:
	1.  As the official uniform of Priests, Priestesses, Monks,
	Nuns (see Nunnery), and Wizards.  The OMT [ Official Management
	Term ] prescribed for the Robes of Priests and Nuns is that
	they _fall in severe folds_; of Priestesses that they _float_;
	and of Wizards that they _swirl_.  You can thus see who you
	are dealing with.
	2.  For Kings.  The OMT here is _falling in stately folds_.
	3.  As the garb of Desert Nomads.  [...]

rod
	Rods were sceptre-like objects that could be used by
	spellcasters to focus their spells, and were particularly favored
	by wizards.  Some magical rods had unique magical powers, often
	found in the possesion of powerful planar beings.  Rods could
	also be employed in battle, and were effective bludgeoning
	instruments.
rock
	Bilbo saw that the moment had come when he must do something.
	He could not get up at the brutes and he had nothing to shoot
	with; but looking about he saw that in this place there were
	many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry little
	watercourse.  Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and
	it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one
	that fitted his hand cosily.  As a boy he used to practise
	throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and
	even birds, got out of his way as quick as lightning if they
	saw him stoop; and even grownup he had still spent a deal of
	his time at quoits, dart-throwing, shooting at the wand,
	bowls, ninepins and other quiet games of the aiming and
	throwing sort - indeed he could do lots of things, besides
	blowing smoke-rings, asking riddles and cooking, that I
	haven't time to tell you about.  There is no time now.  While
	he was picking up stones, the spider had reached Bombur, and
	soon he would have been dead.  At that moment Bilbo threw.
	The stone struck the spider plunk on the head, and it dropped
	senseless off the tree, flop to the ground, with all its legs
	curled up.
		[ The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
rock mole
	A rock mole is a member of the rodent family.  They get their
	name from their ability to tunnel through rock in the same
	fashion that a mole tunnels through earth.  They are known to
	eat anything they come across in their diggings, although it
	is still unknown how they convert some of these things into
	something of nutritional value.

	blundering in the wild. No more will you learn of me; but you
	may have enough of my bounty, as long as you speak fair and
	do not spy or steal." Then again he laughed in his throat.

roshi
	Roshi is a Japanese word, common in Zen Buddhism, meaning "old"
	(ro) and "teacher" (shi).  Roshi can be used as a term of

	actual age, as in the Soto school; or it can mean a teacher who
	has transmitted knowledge to, and thus "given birth" to, a new

*royal jelly
	A lump of royal jelly is a special comestible that is usually only
	found in beehives (it can also be created by a horn of plenty).
	Eating a blessed or uncursed lump of royal jelly will increase
	your strength (if not already maximized) by +1. If cursed, it will
	decrease your strength by one.

	If your legs are injured, they will be healed.

	Your hit points are increased by 0-20 (or decreased if the jelly
	is cursed). If this would raise your HP above your max HP, there
	is a 6.25% chance (1 in 16) to increase your max HP by one.

	"'Royal Jelly,'" he read aloud, "'must be a substance of
	tremendous nourishing power, for on this diet alone, the
	honey-bee larva increases in weight fifteen hundred times in
	five days!'"

	"How much?"

	"Fifteen hundred times, Mabel.  And you know what that means

saber-toothed tiger
saber-toothed cat
	The saber-toothed tiger, a common term for a member of the
	genus Smilodon, is perhaps the most well-known of the
	saber-toothed cats.  Notable for the long, dagger-like fangs
	from which the name of the genus is derived, these apex predators
	stalked mammoths, bison, and other large herbivores across the
	plains of prehistoric North America.
sacrificial knife
	Some knives are crafted in such a way that they are sure to
	catch the attention of the Gods when used. Whether the Gods
	will be pleased, however, is another matter.
saddle
	A saddle is a tool that is used to ride a monster, and is made of
	leather.

	Applying the saddle to a pet that is eligible as a steed allows
	you to ride it. Doing so requires at least one free hand, and the
	saddle will become part of the pet's inventory. It is possible to
	saddle a non-tame monster, but this is more difficult than
	saddling a pet, and you will not be permitted to ride the monster
	until it is tamed. Riding boots give a bonus to successfully
	saddling a monster while worn.

	To remove a saddle from a monster while not riding it, use the
	#loot command, a knock spell, or a wand of opening; the saddle
	will also be removed if the saddled monster is polymorphed into a
	form ineligible to be a steed. Cursed saddles cannot be removed
	via looting, and you cannot mount a monster equipped with a cursed
	saddle; if the saddle is cursed while you are riding, it will
	prevent you from dismounting as well.

	Attempting to saddle a foocubus will produce a unique message and
	abuse wisdom.

	While riding, the saddle is considered part of your inventory as
	well; therefore, the spell and scroll of remove curse can now
	uncurse a cursed saddle that the character is stuck on. Also,
	removing a saddle via the spell of knock or wand of opening while
	riding will force the player off.

	The horseman serves the horse,
	The neat-herd serves the neat,
	The merchant serves the purse,

*salamander
	For hundreds of years, many people believed that salamanders
	were magical.  In England in the Middle Ages, people thought
	that fire created salamanders.  When they set fire to damp
	logs, dozens of the slimy creatures scurried out.  The word
	salamander, in fact, comes from a Greek word meaning "fire
	animal".
		[ Salamanders, by Cherie Winner ]
sandestin
	Ildefonse left the terrace and almost immediately sounds
	of contention came from the direction of the work-room.
	Ildefonse presently returned to the terrace, followed by
	Osherl and a second sandestin using the guise of a gaunt blue
	bird-like creature, some six feet in height.

	Ildefonse spoke in scathing tones:  "Behold these two
	creatures!  They can roam the chronoplex as easily as you
	or I can walk around the table; yet neither has the wit to
	announce his presence upon arrival.  I found Osherl asleep
	in his fulgurite and Sarsem perched in the rafters."
		[...]
	"No matter," said Rhialto.  "He has brought Sarsem, and this
	was his requirement.  In the main, Osherl, you have done well!"

	"And my indenture point?"

	"Much depends upon Sarsem's testimony.  Sarsem, will you sit?"

	"In this guise, I find it more convenient to stand."

	"Then why not alter to human form and join us in comfort at
	the table?"

	"That is a good idea."  Sarsem became a naked young epicene
	in an integument of lavender scales with puffs of purple hair
	like pom-poms growing down his back.  He seated himself at
	the table but declined refreshment.  "This human semblance,
	though typical, is after all, only a guise.  If I were to put
	such things inside myself, I might well become uneasy."

sasquatch
	The name _Sasquatch_ doesn't really become important in Canada
	until the 1930s, when it appeared in the works of J. W. Burns,
	a British Columbian writer who used a great deal of Indian
	lore in his stories.  Burn's Sasquatch was a giant Indian who
	lived in the wilderness.  He was hairy only in the sense that
	he had long hair on his head, and while this Sasquatch lived a
	wild and primitive life, he was fully human.
	Burns's character proved to be quite popular.  There was a
	Sasquatch Inn near the town of Harrison, British Columbia, and
	Harrison even had a local celebration called "Sasquatch Days."
	The celebration which had been dormant for years was revived
	as part of British Columbia's centennial, and one of the
	events was to be a Sasquatch hunt.  The hunt never took place,
	perhaps it was never supposed to, but the publicity about it
	did bring out a number of people who said they had encountered
	a Sasquatch -- not Burns's giant Indian, but the hairy apelike
	creature that we have all come to know.

scroll of air
    When read, this scroll creates a tornado around you.
    - blessed: All monsters within a 4 square radius are hurtled,
      angered and stunned.
    - uncursed: All monsters within a 2 square radius are hurtled,
      angered, and stunned.
    - cursed: You take 3d4 damage (unless you are a form that is
      breathless)

	Confused effects:
	- creates an air elemental if cursed, or a whirling sphere.
scroll of acquirement
    When read, the player may acquire an item, which is like wishing
    except the player can only specify the item class (weapon, armor,
    scroll etc.) to get.

    - If cursed, this scroll has no effect.
    - If blessed, the player gets to choose an item type.
    - If uncursed, the player must pass a (Luck + rn2(5) < 0) check to
    get the acquirement.
scroll of amnesia
    When read, this scroll causes you to forget things(*) and abuses
    your wisdom.

	You forget:
	- all traps on your current level (except any in which you are
	  stuck), and whether you are punished

	- Unless the scroll is blessed, you forget between one and all
	  of your known spells.
	- Being confused rolls this number twice and takes the worse
	  result. However, luck can decrease the number.
	- The chance for decrease goes from about 1/11 at minimum luck
	  (-13) through 1/7 at zero luck to about 1/3 at maximum luck (+13).
	- If the amount is decreased, instead of forgetting n spells, you
	  forget between 1 and n spells.

	- Each spell lost that way abuses your wisdom in addition to the
	  one time guaranteed by reading the scroll.

	- Monsters will not read them.

	(*) Note: object identities and maps are not forgotten.
scroll of charging
    When read, this scroll can be used to charge wands, tools, or
    rings, or to increase your own magical energy.

	The scroll of charging, when read, prompts the player to choose
	an item to which a number of uses (or "charges") will be
	recharged. Blessed scrolls have a higher probability than
	uncursed scrolls to restore more charges on the item (and thus a
	higher chance to restore the maximum number of charges).

	- blessed: In addition to charging the item, also reveals the
	  number of charges and the charge counter.
    - cursed: Sets the number of charges on the item to zero and
      increments the charge counter by 1.

	Confused effects:
	- A noncursed scroll will instead increase your energy to the
	  maximum, unless your energy is already at maximum, in which
	  case your maximum energy will increase by 5-20 points.
	- If cursed, it will instead reduce your current energy to 0.

	Wands:
	- Blessed scrolls will always restore maximum charges to a
	  previously uncharged wand of wishing, and will always
	  restore any given directional wand to at least 4 charges or
	  any nondirectional wand other than wishing to 11 charges.
	  Specifically, a target charge count is determined; this is a
	  random number between the maximum charge count and 4 charges
	  fewer than that (4 to 8 for directional wands; 11 to 15
	  for nondirection wands other than wishing). Uncursed scrolls
	  do the same, but adjust the target charge count to a random
	  number from 1 to the original charge count. The wand then is
	  adjusted to that target charge count if it had fewer charges
	  previously. Otherwise, one charge is added. Wands can only be
	  recharged a certain number of times before the wand explodes,
	  dealing damage to you.
	- A specific change kept from EvilHack is that Wands of Death
	  can only be recharged once.

	Tools:
	- Except for a magic marker, which can only be recharged once,
	  all tools can be charged an unlimited number of times, with
	  varying amounts of charges recharged depending on the item.

	Rings:
	- All rings that have a numeric bonus on them (ie: ring of
	  adornment, can have their enchantment modified by the scroll
	  of charging. A blessed scroll adds between 1-3 points, an
	  uncursed scroll adds 1, and a cursed scroll decreases it by
	  1-2 points.
	- Rings have a chance of being destroyed if the enchantment is
	  too high or too low:

	Current enchantment    <0  0   1   2   3   4   5   6  >=7
	Chance of destruction  0%  0% 14% 29% 43% 57% 71% 86% 100%
scroll of cloning
 When read, this scroll clones an object in your inventory.

	Non-cursed scrolls copy the beatitude of the item to the clone.

    - blessed: Copies the enchantment level or charges, and beatitude.
    - uncursed: Copies the item with the beatitude.
    - cursed: The cloned item will be cursed and have less charges or
      enchantment than the original.

	Confused effects: Creates a clone of yourself.
	- If you are polymorphed, your polymorphed form is cloned and
	  tamed. Otherwise it clones your base form with the following
	  effects based on beatitude.
    - blessed: The clone is tame.
    - uncursed: The clone is peaceful.
    - cursed: The clone is hostile.

	- Unique items (Like the Amulet of Yendor or Bell of Opening) are
	  not valid targets.
	- Artifacts will not be cloned directly but will produce a copy of
	  the base item.
	- Cloned wands of wishing will have their charges set to -1.
	- Cloned magic markers with 16 or more charges will have charges
	  set to 15.
	- If you attempt to clone a stack of items, it will only produce a
	  single object.
scroll of confuse monster
    When read, this scroll grants you the ability to confuse monsters.
    It causes your hands to glow red. The red glow signifies that your
    next non-lethal hit will confuse the target monster unless you are
    in a form that lacks hands; the intensity of the glow represents
    how many uses of the ability you have. Upon hitting a monster
    using your hands or a wielded weapon, a use is consumed and the
    monster must pass a check against its magic resistance, becoming
    confused if they fail the check. This does not occur if the target
    monster is already confused.

    - blessed: adds 2-9 (more) uses.
    - uncursed: only grants one additional use.
    - cursed: confuses you for d100 (more) turns.

	- If you are polymorphed into any non-@ monster form, reading a
	  scroll of any beatitude will also confuse you for d100 (more)
	  turns.

	- While there is no upper limit on uses that can be added, once
	  at least 40 uses are stored, reading a noncursed scroll will
	  only grant one additional use.

	Confused effects:
	- The same occurs if you read a non-blessed scroll while already
	  confused;
	- reading a blessed scroll while confused will instead cure your
	  confusion.
scroll of create monster
    When read, this scroll generates monsters adjacent to you.
    - blessed: 1 monster created.
    - uncursed: 72/73 chance of 1; 1/73 chance of 2 to 5
    - cursed: 72/73 chance of 13; 1/73 chance of 14 to 17

	Confused effects:
	- 72/73 chance of 13 acid blobs; 1/73 chance of 14 to 17 acid blobs

	- Monsters can also read this scroll, with the same effects.
scroll of destroy armor
    When read, this scroll destroys one piece of worn armor.
    - blessed/uncursed: Destroys a random piece of armor.
    - cursed: If a cursed scroll targets cursed armor in this way,
      it stuns you for 10-19 turns and lowers that armor's enchantment
      by one (unless it is at -7) instead of destroying it.

	- If you read the scroll while you are not wearing armor, your
	  strength and constitution are abused. If you are not a beginner,
	  the scroll will be identified - otherwise, "you have a strange
	  feeling for a moment, then it passes".

	Confused effects:
	- Reading a non-cursed scroll while confused removes
	  erodeproofing on a piece of armor.
	- Reading a cursed scroll while confused instead applies
	  erodeproofing a piece of armor, but does not repair it if
	  damaged the way reading a scroll of enchant armor while
	  confused does.
scroll of earth
    When read, this scroll creates boulders.
    - blessed: Creates 8 boulders around the reader without dropping
      one on them,
    - uncursed: Creates 9 boulders - 8 around the reader and one on
      top of their head.
    - cursed: Creates a single boulder over the reader's head.

	- If there is a wall or door where a boulder would normally fall,
	  that boulder will not be created.
	- A boulder that falls on a monster does 1d20 points of damage
	  and can wake up nearby monsters with the noise.
	- if they are wearing a hard helmet, it bounces off and deals
	  just 2 points of damage.
	- A scroll of earth does no damage to amorphous, phasing,
	  noncorporeal, or unsolid monsters.

	- The scroll has no effect on the Rogue level and the Elemental
	  Planes, except for the Plane of Earth.
	- Reading a scroll of earth on a Sokoban level before solving
	  that floor will decrease your Luck by 1.
	- The first level of Sokoban always has two guaranteed scrolls
	  of earth.

	Confused effects:
	- If read while confused, the scroll will create rocks instead of
	  boulders, using the same pattern based on the beatitude of the
	  scroll.
scroll of elementalism
    When read, this scroll summons a variable quantity of elementals.
    Any elemental in the game is eligible

    - blessed: Quantity 1, with a 1/3 chance of being hostile,
      otherwise tame
    - uncursed: Quantity 1, with a 1/2 chance of being hostile,
      otherwise peaceful
    - cursed: Quantity 2-4, always hostile

	Confused effects: If you read the scroll while confused, the
	  scroll will create gas spores, flaming spheres, freezing
	  spheres or shocking spheres. The number and hostility of the
	  created monsters depend on the beatitude of the scroll:
	- blessed: 3-12 tame
	- uncursed: 3-12 hostile
	- cursed: 1 hostile

	- Monsters can read this scroll.
scroll of enchant armor
    This scroll alters the enchantment on armor worn by the reader.

	- If you have not identified this scroll, it chooses at random
	  which piece of armor will be affected. If any armor is worn on
	  the torso, only the outermost worn layer of cloak, body armor,
	  or shirt is eligible.
	- If you have already identified this scroll, you will be able to
	  choose what is enchanted, including your steed's barding.

    - blessed: One worm piece of armor is enchanted and blessed.
        (Details on how the enchantment is calculated below)
	- uncursed: One worn piece of armor is enchanted by +1, and, if
	  it is cursed, made uncursed:
    - cursed: One worn item of armor is randomly selected, cursed,
      and loses one point of enchantment:

	- Blessed enchantment calculation:
	    Current enchantment  Additional possible
		       -3 to −1             1 to 4
		        0 to +2             1 to 3
		       +3 to +5             1 to 2
		       +6 to +8             1
		       +9 or more           0 or 1

	  - The enchantment gain is determined as follows: If the current
	    enchantment is +9 or higher, there is a 1 in (current enchantment)
	    chance of gaining one additional point of enchantment, as with
	    an uncursed scroll.

	  - If the current enchantment is below +9, the armor gains 1
	    point of enchantment, plus a random number from:
	        0 to 3 - (current enchantment / 3)
	  - This means a +3 piece of armor has a 50% chance of being
	    enchanted to +5 by a blessed scroll.

	- If the enchantment of the armor is already above +3, the armor
	  may be destroyed when a non-cursed scroll is read:
	- The probability that the armor will survive is equal to 1
	  divided by the current enchantment.
	- The armor may be safely enchanted with a current enchantment of
	  +5 or lower if:
	      it is elven or
	      it is a cornuthaum and you are a Wizard.

	- If the armor is successfully enchanted beyond the safe limit,
	  it may vibrate.
	- There is a chance of vaporizing negatively-enchanted armor with
	  a cursed scroll, with exactly the same probability as using a
	  noncursed scroll to vaporize a positively enchanted piece of armor.

	Confused effects:
	- Reading a noncursed scroll while confused will repair erosion on
	  one piece of armor, and make the armor erodeproof.
	- As this does not increase the enchantment of the armor, it also
	  does not risk vaporization.
	- Cursed scrolls will not repair damaged armor and will remove,
	  instead of applying, erodeproofing:

	- If the player reads the scroll with no armor worn, their strength
	  and constitution are exercised if non-cursed, or abused if the
	  scroll is cursed:

	- For info on enchanting dragon scales, see "dragon scales"
scroll of enchant weapon
    When read, this scroll alters the enchantment on a weapon wielded
    by the reader.
	- If you are wielding a stack of weapons, the scroll will affect
	  all of them at once.
	- Using a non-cursed scroll on a worm tooth will transform it
	  into a crysknife, and using a cursed scroll on a crysknife will
	  turn it back into a worm tooth.

    - blessed: May enchant by more than 1 point depending on the
        current enchantment.
    - uncursed: Will always try to increase the weapon's enchantment
        by 1 point.
    - cursed: Will decrease the enchantment by 1. A weapon already at
        -6 or below has a 2/3 chance of evaporating.

	- A cursed weapon that is enchanted by reading this scroll will be
	  made uncursed.
	- If you read a scroll of enchant weapon without wielding a weapon
	  or weapon-tool, you will exercise your dexterity instead (or abuse it if the scroll is cursed).

	Enchantment    Points added by blessed scroll
	   -5 to -3    up to 4
	   -2 to +2    up to 3
	   +3 to +5    up to 2
	   +6 to +8    1 (if weapon does not evaporate)

	- If the weapon's current enchantment is +5 or less and you read
	  a blessed scroll, the scroll will add:
	       1 to (3 - (current enchantment) / 3) points.
	- If the current enchantment is +6 or more, the blessed scroll
	  will behave the same as an uncursed scroll.
	- Weapons whose present enchantment is +5 or less can be safely
	  enchanted further;
	- weapons at +6 or above will have a 2/3 chance of evaporating
	  instead when enchanted, and weapons at +9 and above have only
	  a 1-in-(current enchantment) chance of gaining another point
	  of enchantment.

	Confused effects:
	- If read while confused, the scroll will instead affect that
	  weapon's erosion status
	- a non-cursed scroll will erodeproof your weapon and fixes any
	  existing damage.
	- A cursed scroll will remove the erodeproofing instead.
scroll of fire
    When read, this scroll causes an explosion of fire.
    - uncursed: Creates an explosion of fire in a 3x3 square area
      centered on the player.
	  This deals 2-3 fire damage to you and any monsters around you.
	  It also boils potions, damages worn armor, and burns scrolls
	  and spellbooks in your inventory, monster inventories, and on
	  the ground.
    - cursed: Same effect as an uncursed scroll, but only deals 1-2
      damage to each target.

    - blessed: Allows you to center the explosion on a nearby visible
      square (with the same restrictions as a scroll of stinking
      cloud), and the explosion deals 15, 20, or 25 damage.

	Confused effects:
	- If not fire resistant, you instead lose 1 HP with no effect on
	  your inventory or your gloves.

	- The explosion of fire burns away any slime covering you.
	- This scroll will never be destroyed by fire damage that normally
	  affects carried items.
scroll of flood
	Creates pools of water around the player.

	- non-blessed scrolls have a chance of putting a water tile on the
	  player's posision.

	Confused effects:
	- Instead removes water from vicinity of player.

	Scrolls of flood cannot be blanked in water.
scroll of food detection
    When read, this scroll reveals the location of all comestibles
    on the level.
    - uncursed: detects and reveals the location of all comestibles
      on the level, including those on the ground and in monster
      inventories
    - blessed: you additionally acquire the food appraisal intrinsic.
    - cursed/confused: you will detect potions instead.
scroll of genocide
   The effects  depend on the scroll's beatitude, including confused
   readings:
    - blessed: You may eliminate a single monster species from the
      entire dungeon.
    - uncursed: You may eliminate a single monster species from the
      current level.
    - cursed: 4-6 monsters of the chosen species are summoned.
      Monsters generated this way do not carry any inventory

	Confused effects:
	- blessed: Same as a blessed non-confused scroll.
	- uncursed: You genocide your own role, causing instadeath.
	- cursed: 4-6 hostile player monsters of your role are summoned.
	  Monsters generated this way do not carry any inventory

	- Monsters will not read this scroll.
scroll of gold detection
    When read, this scroll finds all gold on the current level. It
    can also be used to find traps.
    - uncursed: Reveals gold pieces, gold golems and any gold hidden
      in containers, buried, or embedded in rock.
    - blessed: Also detects objects made of gold.
    - cursed: See confused effect.

	Confused effects:
	- Detects traps.
	- Confused reading shows only real traps, not magic portals.
	- If non-cursed, all traps on the level will be revealed to the
	  player with the ^ or " symbols (of the appropriate color).
	- If the scroll was cursed, regardless if you are confused or
	  not, all traps on the level will be marked with a $ as if the
	  scroll was detecting gold.
scroll of ice
	Transforms some floor tiles into ice tiles.

	Confused effects:
	- Removes any lava tiles in the vicinity of the player.

scroll of identify
    When read, this scroll reveals the full identity of at least one
    unknown item in the player's inventory.

	If the scroll is blessed or uncursed, it will identify 1, 2, 3,
	4, or all items in the inventory, with the probability of each
	number given in the table below. If this is less than the number
	of unidentified items in the inventory, the player chooses which
	items to identify first.

	BUC              Number of items
                 1     2     3     4   all
	Blessed    1/5   1/5   1/5   1/5   1/5
	Uncursed 21/25  1/25  1/25  1/25  1/25
	Cursed       1     0     0     0     0

	- If your Luck is positive, a blessed scroll has a 2/5 chance of
	identifying 2 items, and will never identify just one.

	Confused effects:
	- The scroll's type is identified:  ("You identify this as an
	  identify scroll.")
	- You also get the enlightenment effect: "You identify yourself..."


scroll of knowledge

	permanent light around you.
    - blessed: creates a 9-unit radius of light.
    - uncursed: creates light in a 5-square radius
    - cursed: instead darkens a 5-square area around you.

	Confused effects:
	- Creates a radius of darkness corresponding to the scroll's
	  beatitude around you.
	- However, they also have a 1/5 chance to instead summon a
	  light monster
	- noncursed scrolls can summon a yellow light,
	- cursed scrolls can summon a black light.
scroll of magic mapping
    When read, this scroll maps the entire current level, providing
    the scroll is not cursed, the level is mappable, and you are not
    confused.
    - blessed: The whole level is mapped, and secret doors revealed.
    - uncursed: The whole level is mapped.
    - cursed/confused: 1/7 of the level's squares are mapped.
	- non-mappable level: You are confused for 1 to 30 (more) turns.
scroll of magic detection
    When read, this scroll detects magical objects on (and buried
    around) the current level, and in the players inventory. It also
    detects monsters capable of magic on the level.

    - blessed: Identify fully those same items (but not their beatitude).
    - uncursed: Label such items as 'magical'.
    - cursed: Wakes up and unparalyzes magical monsters. Mimics
      imitating magical objects appear as their disguises.
scroll of punishment

    to you, which hinders your movements.
    - blessed/confused: No effect ("You feel guilty".)

    - uncursed & unpunished: You are punished

      inventory (and saddle if riding).
    - uncursed: Unpunishes, and uncurses all cursed equipped items
      and loadstones (and saddle if riding)

scroll of scare monster
    When read, this scroll
    - blessed/uncursed: causes monsters in your visual range to flee,
      subject to each monsters magic resistance score.
    - cursed/confused: monsters in visual range will wake up, become
      unparalyzed, and unscared.

	On the ground:
	- When you stand on a square where a scroll of scare monster is
	  on the ground, most monsters will become scared and flee instead
	  of attacking you in melee.
	- Unlike Elbereth, this works on peaceful monsters, pets, blind
	  monsters, and minotaurs; it also works in Gehennom and the End Game

	- Monsters scared by this scroll will avoid walking on it unless
	  they are blind, human or a minotaur.
	- Standing on this scroll will NOT scare any @ monsters, unique
	  monsters, angelic beings (A), the Riders, or the Wizard of Yendor.

	Beatitude, degradation and disintegration
	- If you pick up a blessed scroll of scare monster, it will become
	  uncursed.
	- if you try to pick up a cursed one, it will disintegrate.
	- An uncursed one will set an internal flag the first time you
	  pick it up, and disintegrate the next time unless you have
	  blessed it - as this flag is not reset by blessing the scroll,
	  any individual scroll can only be picked up while uncursed once.
	  Scrolls that have been picked up once while uncursed will not
	  stack with those that haven't. Removing a scroll from a
	  container on the ground or in your inventory has no ill effect
	  on it.
scroll of stinking cloud
    When read, this scroll allows you to center a cloud of poison gas
    around a point of your choice on the dungeon map. This point must
    be visible and within a range of 5.6 tiles, but the actual cloud
    need not. Blessed scrolls give a larger cloud and do more damage;
    cursed scrolls give a smaller cloud and do less damage.

	The stinking cloud causes damage and angers monsters, save those
	that are nonliving or unbreathing. Poison resistant monsters do
	not take damage, but are still angered. Monsters with eyes are
	blinded.

	The lifespan of the cloud is dependent upon the BUC status of the
	scroll; after 4-6 turns, a cloud created by a cursed scroll will
	disappear, while a cloud created by a non-cursed scroll will
	undergo a first dissipation, after which it will cause less damage.
	Then, after two more turns, a cloud created by an uncursed scroll
	will disappear, while a cloud created by a blessed scroll will
	undergo a second dissipation, after which it will cause even less
	damage. Then the cloud will disappear.

    - blessed: 4x4 cloud. 8-10 turn lifespan.
    - uncursed: 3x3 cloud. 6-8 turn lifespan.
    - cursed: 2x2 could. 4-6 turn lifespan.

	Confused effects:
	- cursed/uncursed: Creates a large number of gas spores throughout
	  the level (30-99).
	- blessed: Creates 1, 2, or 3 fern spores.
scroll of taming
    - Reading a non-cursed scroll will tame monsters adjacent to you
      if they do not succeed a check against monster magic resistance,
      similar to the spell of charm monster; the standard restrictions
      for pets apply.
    - cursed: Reading a cursed scroll will instead turn peaceful
      monsters adjacent to you hostile.

	- The taming effect will pacify any hostile monster that were
	  formerly peaceful, such as shopkeepers and aligned priests.

	Confused effects:
	- Reading the scroll while confused increases the range of the
	  effects above to within 5 squares of your location (i.e. an
	  11x11 area), including beyond walls. If the scroll is read and
	  no monsters are affected, "nothing interesting" happens, and
	  you will be prompted to type-name the scroll afterward.

	- In all cases, if you are engulfed, the effects will only be
	  applied to the engulfing monster, as opposed to any other
	  nearby monsters.
scroll of teleportation
    When read, this scroll teleports the player.
    - blessed: You are asked where you want to teleport.
    - uncursed: You are randomly teleported to a location within
      the same level.
    - cursed: You are teleported to another level.

	- If the player has teleport control, they will always be asked
	  where they want to be teleported.
	- Otherwise, the teleport is uncontrolled and the new location
	  will be chosen randomly.
	- All "safe" places on the current level are equally likely;
	- see "level teleport" for uncontrolled levelporting.

	Confused effects:
	- If you have teleport control, always allows a player to level
	  teleport and pick the level;
	- however, there is still a chance dependent on Luck that the
	  teleport may be random.
	- Having at least +11 Luck will result in success about 98% of
	  the time.

	- When carrying Amulet of Yendor, there is a 1/3 chance that
	  nothing happens, producing the message "You feel disoriented
	  for a moment." This always happens if you attempt a levelport
	  while carrying the Amulet. Trying to teleport on a no-teleport
	  level such as Sokoban will instead produce the message "A
	  mysterious force prevents you from teleporting!" to indicate
	  that all teleport attempts will fail.
scroll of time
    When read, this scroll grants you a large number of movement points.

    - blessed: 75 movement points (effectively 6.25 more turns)
    - uncursed: 50 movement points (effectively 4.2 more turns)
    - cursed: Paralyze you for 15-19 turns.

    - For reference a normal speed turn is 12 movement points.

	Confused effects:
	- blessed: Paralyzes you for 5-9 turns.
	- uncursed: Paralyzes you for 10-14 turns.
	- cursed: Paralyzes you for 15-19 turns.
scroll of transmogrify
    When read, this scroll changes the material of your wielded weapon
      or worn armor.
    - blessed: Blesses and transforms the object to a random material.
    - uncursed: Transforms the object to a random material
    - cursed/confused: Curses the object chosen and removes any
      erodeproofing. It also attempts to convert the object material
      to plastic (if valid), and if not possible just chooses a random
      material.

	- If you aren't wearing anything to change, you will feel strange.
	- If cursed, you'll abuse constitution and strength, otherwise you
	  exercise it.

shark
	As the shark moved, its dark top reflected virtually no

shopkeeper
	There have been three general theories put forward to explain
	the phenomenon of the wandering shops or, as they are
	generically known, _tabernae vagantes._
	The first postulates that many thousands of years ago there
	evolved somewhere in the multiverse a race whose single talent
	was to buy cheap and sell dear.  Soon they controlled a vast
	galactic empire or, as they put it, Emporium, and the more
	advanced members of the species found a way to equip their very
	shops with unique propulsion units that could break the dark
	walls of space itself and open up vast new markets.  And long
	after the worlds of the Emporium perished in the heat death of
	their particular universe, after one last defiant fire sale,
	the wandering starshops still ply their trade, eating their way
	through the pages of spacetime like a worm through a three-
	volume novel.
	The second is that they are the creation of a sympathetic Fate,
	charged with the role of supplying exactly the right thing
	at the right time.
	The third is that they are simply a very clever way of getting
	around the various Sunday Closing acts.
	All these theories, diverse as they are, have two things in
	common.  They explain the observed facts, and they are
	completely and utterly wrong.

	the alarm had been raised[...]
	Suddenly, a large, dark shape rose from the abyss before them,
	its fetid bulk looming overhead... The monster was some kind of
	great dark worm, but that was about all they were sure of.

skeleton
	A skeleton is a magically animated undead creature.  Unlike
	shades, only a humanoid creature can be used to create a

	an accepted fact amongst the practitioners of the black arts.
slasher
	"That dog belonged to a settler who tried to build his cabin
	on the bank of the river a few miles south of the fort,"
	grunted Conan. ...  "We took him to the fort and dressed his
	wounds, but after he recovered he took to the woods and turned
	wild.  -- What now, Slasher, are you hunting the men who
	killed your master?" ...  "Let him come," muttered Conan.
	"He can smell the devils before we can see them." ...
	Slasher cleared the timbers with a bound and leaped into the
	bushes.  They were violently shaken and then the dog slunk
	back to Balthus' side, his jaws crimson. ...  "He was a man,"
	said Conan.  "I drink to his shade, and to the shade of the
	dog, who knew no fear."  He quaffed part of the wine, then
	emptied the rest upon the floor, with a curious heathen
	gesture, and smashed the goblet.  "The heads of ten Picts
	shall pay for this, and seven heads for the dog, who was a
	better warrior than many a man."

*slime
	A hideous growth, green slime is bright green, sticky, and wet. It
	grows in dark subterranean places on walls, ceilings and floors.
	... Green slime attaches itself to living flesh and in 1-4 melee
	rounds turns the creature into green slime ... Green slime is an
	infestation that all creatures avoid; it is burned out of caverns
	or mines if found. Once it has infected an area, it has a tendency
	to grow back, even after being frozen or burned away, because dormant
	spores can germinate years later.
		[ Monstrous Manual, by TSR inc. ]
slime mold
	Science fiction did not invent the slime molds, but it has
	borrowed from them in using the idea of sheets of liquid, flowing
	cytoplasm engulfing and dissolving every living thing they touch.
	What fiction can only imagine, nature has produced, and only their
	small size and dependence on coolness, moisture, and darkness has
	kept the slime molds from ordinary observation, for they are common
	enough.

sling
	And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came and
	drew nigh to meet David, that David hasted, and ran toward
	the army to meet the Philistine.
	And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
	and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
	the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face
	to the earth.
	So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with
	a stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there
	was no sword in the hand of David.

	Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field

	hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?
	And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
	the trees of the garden:  but of the fruit of the tree which is
	in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of
	it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.  And the serpent
	said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:  for God doth
	know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be
	opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.  And
	when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it
	was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one
	wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also
	unto her husband with her; and he did eat.

	And the Lord God said unto the woman, What is this that thou
	hast done?  And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I
	did eat.  And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou
	hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above
	every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and
	dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life:  And I will put
	enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her
	seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.

	"It's a Snark!" was the sound that first came to their ears,

	Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air

	That sounded like "-jum!" but the others declare
	    It was only a breeze that went by.

sokoban
	Sokoban (Japanese for "warehouse keeper") is a transport puzzle
	in which the player pushes boxes around a maze, viewed from

	box may be pushed at a time, not two, and boxes cannot be pulled.
	As the puzzle would be extremely difficult to create physically,
	it is usually implemented as a video game.

	Sokoban was created in 1982 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and was
	published by Thinking Rabbit, a software house based in

	encounters with soldiers say they travel together in platoons,

spellbook of dig
	Allows you to learn the spell of dig.

	When cast, it has a similar effect to zapping a wand of digging -
	it fires a ray in a selected direction that digs through walls and
	can create holes in the floor.
spellbook of magic missile
	Allows you to learn the spell of magic missile.

	The magic missile ray does ((xplev/2) + 1)d6 damage + spell damage
	bonus, so higher-level spellcasters can deal significant damage
	with this spell. A level 30 character deals 16d6 damage with magic
	missile, averaging 56 damage per hit.

	This spell's damage is doubled for Knights by carrying the Magic
	Mirror of Merlin, any character with DeathVision, or a character
	wielding the Staff of Rot while withering.
spellbook of fireball
	Allows you to learn the spell of fireball. This spellbook is
	fireproof, preventing it from being destroyed by other sources
	of fire damage.

	The spell of fireball is a medium-level attack spell that has
	different effects depending on the character's skill level in
	matter spells; both versions will produce an explosion of fire.
	Monsters caught in the explosion are hit for 12d6; monsters with
	cold resistance take double damage, while targets with monster MR
	may resist for half the damage. If you are caught in an explosion,
	you take 6d6 damage unless you have fire resistance; this will
	cure sliming.

	Ice in the affected squares melt into pools of water, while pools
	and fountains evaporate and dry up; pools will leave pits behind,
	while moats will not be affected. Closed doors will be destroyed,
	but other objects such as boulders are unaffected. Scrolls, books
	and potions in the explosion's area may be destroyed, while cloth
	and leather items may be burnt. This includes items in affected
	monsters' inventories. Exploding potions will subject nearby
	monsters to their vapors.

	Casting the spell at Basic skill or lower creates a ray of fire;
	You are prompted for a direction in which to cast the spell. When
	the ray hits an obstacle or monster, it explodes, affecting the
	hit square and all 8 adjacent squares.

	When casting the spell at Skilled or higher, you may choose a
	location to target the spell with. The following must apply for a
	tile to be eligible:

	- The location is no more than 10 squares away.
	- The square must be an open space.
	- You must be able to see the chosen square normally (i.e. it must
	  be lit and in line of sight).

	If you are engulfed, the explosions will be centered around
	yourself, and nothing will be affected outside the engulfing
	monster. If you are on the Plane of Water, you are prevented from
	casting the spell outright.

	Two to nine explosions will follow. If there is a wall on the
	straight line between you and your target, the spell will explode
	around the square immediately before the first wall; otherwise,
	the explosions will be centered around the location you chose. The
	first explosion is centered on the selected location, and the
	subsequent ones will occur randomly on that square or any of the
	eight squares around it; the explosions themselves each affect a
	3x3 square area around their center.
spellbook of cone of cold
	Allows you to learn the spell of cone of cold.

	At Unskilled or Basic skill level, the spell zaps a ray with the
	same effect as a wand of cold. You are prompted for a direction in
	which to cast the spell; you can also zap it at yourself, although
	this is not recommended.

	Monsters caught in the cold ray take (XL/2 + 1)d6 damage, plus
	damage bonus. Fire resistant monsters take an additional
	(XL/2 + 1)d3 damage. Cold resistant monsters take no damage. The
	ray will also reveal unseen monsters, as well as destroy doors and
	freeze watery tiles (puddles, sewage, pools). Any potions on the
	monsters (or your) inventory are subject to shattering.

	If zapped at yourself, you take 12-72 damage depending on how
	resistant to cold you are.

	At Skilled or Expert level, you may choose a location at which to
	cast explosions of cold, with the following restrictions:

	- this location must be no more than 10 squares away;
	- it must be an open space;
	- you must either see the chosen square normally (it must be lit
	  and in the line of sight) or sense a monster on it via telepathy,
	  infravision, a blessed potion of monster detection, or its spell
	  equivalent (warning will not suffice).

	The last two conditions do not need to be met if you are engulfed.
	In this case, the explosions will be centered around yourself, and
	nothing will be affected outside the engulfing entity.

	If there is a wall on the straight line between you and your
	target, the spell will explode around the square immediately
	before the first wall. Otherwise, the explosions will be
	centered around the location you chose. 2 to 9 explosions follow;
	the first is in the center, the subsequent ones randomly at any of
	the nine squares around that point. Each explosion affects the
	surrounding squares.

	The damage to non-cold-resistant monsters is just XL/2 + 1 plus
	spell damage bonus, halved if they resist, doubled if they are
	resistant to fire, and doubled again is they're grabbing you and
	you're within blast radius. Monsters are dealt additional damage
	equal to the number of potion stacks in their inventory, even if
	they're cold resistant and potions didn't freeze.

	Any explosions that would be centered on yourself do not take
	place, but instead do damage as 'zap self' above.

	Explosions produce noise.
spellbook of sleep
	Allows you to learn the spell of sleep.

	Casting it has the same effect as zapping a wand of sleep:
	monsters will be put to sleep for (level/2 + 1)d25 turns, where
	level is your experience level.

	Monsters can resist this spell with monster magic resistance, and
	it has no effect on already-sleeping or paralyzed monsters.
	Attacking monsters in melee has a 10% chance of waking them up.
	Bolts of sleep bounce from walls and unidentified secret doors,
	but are absorbed by known doors.
spellbook of finger of death
	Allows you to learn the spell of finger of death.

	The spellbook is most commonly received through wizard crowning:
	it is given on crowning if the wizard does not already have one
	and is not wielding Vorpal Blade or Stormbringer. The spellbook
	received this way is always blessed.

	Finger of death is the most powerful attack spell. The ray
	produced by this spell has the same effect as a wand of death: it
	instantly kills any monster it hits, unless the monster is resists
	death magic (see below), or has magic resistance or reflection.
	Your skill in attack spells has no significant effect on finger of
	death, other than increasing the spellcasting success rate and to-
	hit probability.

	Zapping yourself directly with the spell is an instadeath,
	regardless of reflection or magic resistance, and is a very bad
	idea.

	Monsters that resist death magic:
	- Death
	- major demon
	- angels, devas
	- nonliving
	- quest leaders
	- juggernauts
	- shadow ogres, shadow wolves
	- statue gargoyles
	- moldy puddings
	- black marketeers
	- Cerberus
	- Nightmare
	- Ragnaros
spellbook of lightning
	Allows you to learn the spell of lightning.

	Largely identical to the wand of lightning except dealing
	(xplev/2 + 1)d6 damage to non-shock-resistant targets instead of
	the 6d6 of the wand.

	It can be reflected, but magic resistance doesn't stop it.
spellbook of poison blast
	Allows you to learn the spell of poison blast.

	At unskilled or basic skill, poison blast generates a ray akin to
	the poison blast of a green dragon or iron golem; it deals
	(xplev/2 + 1)d6 damage to non-poison resistant targets. If the
	blast hits the player, it has a 1 in 15 chance of being deadly
	poison (instadeath) and a 1 in 3 chance of dealing dexterity damage.

	At skilled and expert level, the spell may be targeted at a
	location no more than 10 squares away that is in sight and an open
	space. The explosion cannot be cast underwater or on the Plane of
	Water; if used while swallowed, it is automatically cast on your
	own location.

	Two to nine explosions are generated; the first is centered at the
	target location, and subsequent explosions are randomly placed on
	any of the nine squares around that point (unless swallowed). Each
	explosion affects the surrounding squares as the unskilled/basic
	spell, with the exception that the player suffers only the damage
	and not the additional poisoning effects.
spellbook of acid blast
	Allows you to learn the spell of acid blast.

	At unskilled or basic skill, poison blast generates a ray akin to
	the acid blast of a yellow dragon; it deals (xplev/2 + 1)d6 damage
	to non-acid resistant targets and corrodes weapon and armor on an
	independent 1-in-6 chance for each.

	At skilled and expert level, the spell may be targeted at a
	location no more than 10 squares away that is in sight and an open
	space. The explosion cannot be cast underwater or on the Plane of
	Water; if used while swallowed, it is automatically cast on your
	own location.

	Two to nine explosions are generated; the first is centered at the
	target location, and subsequent explosions are randomly placed on
	any of the nine squares around that point (unless swallowed). Each
	explosion deals damage as the unskilled/basic spell; only the
	damage is dealt, and weapons and armor are not eroded.
spellbook of sonicboom
	Allows you to learn the spell of sonicboom.

	Similar to a cone of cold, but inflicts sonic damage.
spellbook of psionic wave
	Illithids have a natural psionic attack that can confuse and kill,
	and is tied to spell power use (but is not considered a spell for
	the purposes of Amulet of Yendor interactions). If your race is
	changed (e.g. by getting crowned as an infidel), this ability is
	lost.
	The psionic wave does 2d6 psychic damage. At Level 26, this
	increases to 4d6 psychic damage.
spellbook of force bolt
	Allows you to learn the spell of force bolt.

	Casting the spell allows you to shoot a force bolt in any
	direction, the same as a wand of striking. If the bolt hits a
	monster, it does 2d12 damage; monsters may resist for half damage.
	Monsters with player-style magic resistance take no damage.

	The force bolt will break any boulder, statue, door or drawbridge
	that it hits. It will also break fragile items such as potions.
	Iron bars that are hit also have a chance of breaking (not on
	certain levels however). Note that if a monster is killed by a
	force bolt beam, the monster's inventory will be subjected to the
	beam.

	It has a fixed chance of hitting, not affected by the player's
	dexterity or spell skills; if the roll of a d20 is lower than
	(10 + monster's AC), the spell hits.

	Force bolt can pass the first monster it hits, also hitting monsters behind it.
spellbook of drain life
	Allows you to learn the spell of drain life.

	Casting it at a monster drains one level from it, does 1d8 × 2
	damage, and decreases the monster's maximum HP by 1d8 (with spell
	bonuses applicable to both). The base damage and HP reduction is
	doubled if you are a Knight carrying the Magic Mirror of Merlin,
	have DeathVision, or are withering while wielding the Staff of Rot.
	The monster's location will be revealed, if it is unseen. If the
	monster resists the spell through monster magic resistance, it will
	not be level drained, will suffer only 25% damage to its current HP,
	and will suffer no damage to its max HP. Monsters with drain
	resistance are not affected at all.

	If the spell is cast at an object, the object will resist 90% of
	the time if it is an artifact, or 10% of the time otherwise. If
	the object does not resist, its charge or enchantment is reduced
	by 1. An object cannot have its charge or enchantment reduced
	below zero, and any objects with negative enchantments are
	unaffected.

	Casting the spell at yourself drains one experience level with the
	usual message, as if you were hit with a monster's drain life
	attack, unless you are drain resistant. Losing a level reduces
	your maximum hit points and your hit points by the same amount,
	down to a minimum of one. If you are drained below experience
	level 1, you die.
spellbook of summon undead
	Allows you to learn the spell of summon undead.

	On casting, there is a 72 in 73 chance of creating one undead
	monster and a 1 in 73 chance of creating five undead. The undead
	monsters will be V (1/10 chance), Z (4/10 chance), M (3/10 chance),
	(1/10 chance), or W (1/10 chance).

	If the player is a Necromancer they will automatically attempt to
	dominate the resulting monster(s). If the player is not a
	necromancer but knows the command undead spell they will auto-cast
	command undead. In either case the monster(s) may resist, based on
	their MR. The differences between the two cases is that non-
	Necromancers must expend additional power to cast the second spell,
	and Necromancers will dominate the resulting monsters, even if
	they are not undead - this is especially relevant for fire vampires
	and star vampires, which are V but not undead.
spellbook of command undead
	Allows you to learn the spell of command undead.

	This spell is equivalent to charm monster, except that it only
	affects undead.
spellbook of knock
	Allows you to learn the spell of knock.

	The effect is the exact same as a wand of opening, and will unlock
	doors and containers, as well as revealing hidden doors.

	However, it has many other uses besides the obvious: as a matter
	spell, it can be used to train for casting more powerful spells in
	the school, notably polymorph. It can also expose secret doors
	whose locations are known to the player but not the character
	(especially on special levels), and can open the Castle drawbridge
	without needing an instrument to play the passtune.

	Casting knock also unlocks doors at a distance and does so slightly
	faster than a key would manage; because of this, it might be useful
	on the Astral Plane, though a wand of digging is better because it
	will raze the doors. The spell also causes engulfing monsters to
	expel you, making it useful on the Plane of Air. It can also free
	you from most kinds of "holding traps", including bear traps,
	webs, pits, buried iron ball, or being stuck in the floor.
	Technically it can also free you from being stuck in lava, but
	usually you will immediately start sinking again (unless you're
	e.g. levitating).

	Lastly, knock will also open iron safes and crystal chests.
spellbook of wizard lock
	Allows you to learn the spell of wizard lock.

	When cast, the effect is the same as that of a wand of locking,
	closing and locking any open doors and lockable containers in the
	direction it was cast; if cast at an empty doorway, it will
	create a locked door.
spellbook of polymorph
	Allows you to learn the spell of polymorph.

	Casting a beam that changes any monster, item, or player it hits
	into something else of its type.
spellbook of repair armor
	Allows you to learn the spell of repair armor.

	When cast, repairs one level of damage to any worn piece of armor.
	Will not make armor items fixed, but will bring them back to a new
	undamaged state. This spell is significant, as the monster spell
	'destroy armor' can un-fix and damage your armor to the point that
	it's destroyed completely, even armor that is inherently
	erodeproof. The spell will choose a worn piece of armor at random
	to fix if unskilled in casting matter-based spells, otherwise at
	basic or higher skill, the player can select which piece of armor
	to repair.
spellbook of reflection
	Allows you to learn the spell of reflection.

	Creates a temporary reflective bubble around the caster, acts
	exactly the same as an amulet of reflection or silver dragon
	scales.
spellbook of flame sphere
	Allows you to learn the spell of flame sphere.

	Creates a tame flaming sphere that will explode itself on any
	nearby enemies. Will dissipate if not used in a timely manner.
spellbook of freeze sphere
	Allows you to learn the spell of freeze sphere.

	Creates a tame freezing sphere that will explode itself on any
	nearby enemies. Will dissipate if not used in a timely manner.
spellbook of cancellation
	Allows you to learn the spell of cancellation.

	When cast, it fires a beam which works exactly like the wand of
	cancellation: items will be uncursed and unenchanted, scrolls and
	most spellbooks will be blanked, most wands and magical tools lose
	their charges, and most potions will be turned into water.
	Monsters hit by the spell must each pass a monster MR check; if
	they fail, they can lose a lot or all of their special attacks.

	The spellbook of cancellation is the only book that cannot be
	cancelled into a spellbook of blank paper by the spell or wand of
	cancellation, and the spell also cannot cancel the wand of
	cancellation or the wand of nothing.
spellbook of fire bolt
	Allows you to learn the spell of fire bolt.

	Fire Bolt only appears in the Flame Mage's starting inventory and
	is not randomly generated. The spellbook itself is immune to fire.

	When cast, this shoots a fire attack (similar to force bolt) that
	doesn't reflect and can hit multiple targets. It destroys doors,
	trees, grass, webs, fountains and can instakill straw and paper
	golems.

	Damage scales with level:
	- Level 1 = 1d10 fire damage
	- Level 4 = 1d10 + 1d8 fire damage
	- Level 8 = 1d10 + 2d8 fire damage
	- Level 12 = 1d10 + 3d8 fire damage
	- Matter at Skilled adds +1d4 fire damage
	- Matter at Expert adds +1d4 fire damage
spellbook of slow monster
	Allows you to learn the spell of slow monster.

	When cast, the spell acts similarly to a wand of slow monster: if
	you cast it at a monster and they do not resist, it renders them
	slow (i.e. 2/3 of their normal speed). If the target(s) were
	already fast, they are returned to normal speed. If cast at a
	monster while it has you engulfed, you are immediately expelled.

	If zapped at yourself, you gain intrinsic slowness for 13-23
	turns.
spellbook of cause fear
	Allows you to learn the spell of cause fear.

	Casting this spell has the same effect as reading a scroll of
	scare monster: it will scare monsters, causing them to to run away.
	The downside of this method (versus those caused by more mundane
	or divine sources) is that it is subject to the target's monster
	magic resistance and immunities; once scared, a monster with full
	HP has a 4% chance of recovering each turn. It has no effect on
	pets.
spellbook of charm monster
	Allows you to learn the spell of charm monster.

	This spell has the basic effect of an uncursed scroll of taming,
	turning adjacent monsters into pets. Monsters have a chance of
	resisting it, depending on their magic resistance. Covetous or
	human monsters will be pacified instead, as are demons unless you
	are a demon yourself; the Wizard of Yendor, Medusa and the quest
	nemesis cannot be pacified or tamed. The taming effect will also
	pacify any angry shopkeepers it affects, even if they would
	normally resist.

	Note: The SLASH'EM mechanics of traitorous and untameable monsters
	have been added. This means that many monsters that a player would
	typically tame with charm monster will now be able to turn hostile
	on a whim (or not be tamable at all).
spellbook of confuse monster
	Allows you to learn the spell of confuse monster.

	Casting this spell has exactly the same effect as a scroll of
	confuse monster; your hands will "glow red", confusing the next
	monster you attack in melee, subject to monster magic resistance.

	If cast at a skilled level of enchantment skill, it works like a
	blessed scroll of confuse monster instead, giving 2-9 more uses of
	this ability. You can store up to 40 uses.

	If you are polymorphed into a form not represented by @, the spell
	has a different effect: you confuse yourself (for 1-100 turns).
	The confused scroll effects are not available via the spell,
	because confusion prevents spellcasting for players.
spellbook of haste self
	Allows you to learn the spell of haste self.

	When cast, the spell gives you very fast speed temporarily, and
	can be cast cumulatively to increase the number of turns the
	effect lasts for. At Unskilled or Basic, the haste effect lasts
	for 100-109 (more) turns - at Skilled or Expert, it lasts for 160-
	169 (more) turns.

	Unlike a potion of speed, it will not heal wounded legs, but still
	exercises dexterity when cast and will cure you of intrinsic
	slowness.
spellbook of levitation
	Allows you to learn the spell of levitation.

	Casting the spell of levitation at Basic skill or lower in escape
	spells has the same effect as an uncursed potion of levitation -
	it grants you levitation for 10 to 149 (more) turns. Casting it at
	Skilled or higher has the same effect as a blessed potion, giving
	you 250 to 299 (more) turns of levitation as well as the ability
	to land at will using the > command.

	Note that you must be at the appropriate skill-level at the time
	of casting; if you cast it while Basic and then train to Skilled,
	you will not be able to land at will unless you cast it again.
spellbook of teleport away
	Allows you to learn the spell of teleport away.

	The spell is a beam-type spell that can be aimed at monsters or at
	yourself.

	Casting this spell at yourself has the same effect as the teleport
	at will action or zapping yourself with a wand of teleportation -
	unless you are on a no-teleport level, you teleport to a random
	square on the current level that you can stand on (e.g. in your
	default form, you won't end up over water, inside a wall or
	monster, on a trap, etc.). The teleportation is not inherently
	controlled, but if you have teleport control, you can use that to
	control your destination.

	The spell can be used on monsters, with similar effects to a wand
	of teleportation; the monster will teleport to a random square on
	the current level on which it can survive.
spellbook of passwall
	Allows you to learn the spell of passwall.

	Casting the spell grants temporary intrinsic phasing, allowing you
	to pass through solid walls and other objects for anywhere between
	50 and 149 turns before they become solid again; if you are in a
	solid object when the phasing wears off, you will be stuck there
	unless you can dig yourself out, pray, or cast the spell again.
spellbook of invisibility
	Allows you to learn the spell of invisibility.

	Casting this spell at any skill level causes you to turn invisible
	for 31 to 45 (more) turns.
spellbook of jumping
	Allows you to learn the spell of jumping.

	Casting allows you to jump to other tiles within a certain range,
	allowing you to pass over unavoidable traps and escape too-tough
	monsters. You must be able to see the landing spot, meaning that
	you cannot jump while blind, and you cannot jump over monsters;
	you will bump into them instead, angering them if they were
	peaceful. See the main article and its path section for more
	detailed information on jumping and whether a given jump will
	bring you in contact with a monster. Casting jump consumes d25
	nutrition, in addition to the ordinary hunger penalty.

spellbook of light
	Allows you to learn the spell of light.

	Casting the spell of light has the same effect as an uncursed
	scroll of light: a circular area with 5 squares radius around your
	position (while casting) is permanently made lit.
spellbook of detect monsters
	Allows you to learn the spell of detect monsters.

	At unskilled or basic skill level, the spell functions as an
	uncursed potion of monster detection, displaying the monsters of
	that dungeon level against a black background with no map detail,
	and allowing you to select monsters with the cursor to identify
	them; once you end the effect, the monsters revealed by the spell
	vanish from view. At skilled or expert level it functions as a
	blessed potion, revealing monsters on the map for 21-60 (more)
	turns; if you already have over 300 turns of monster detection,
	only one turn is added.
spellbook of detect food
	Allows you to learn the spell of detect food.

	Casting this spell has the same effect as the scroll of food
	detection, revealing the location of all comestibles on the level,
	on the ground and even in monster inventories. If cast at Skilled
	or Expert, you will also acquire the food appraisal intrinsic.
	This spell is the only one in HackEM that does not cause spell
	hunger at all, which is especially important given its function.
spellbook of detect unseen
	Allows you to learn the spell of detect unseen.

	Has the same effect as a wand of secret door detection.	It reveals
	secret doors and corridors, non-statue traps, portals, mimics,
	hidden, submerged and invisible monsters in an area of radius 8
	within line-of-sight. On the Plane of Air only, it also
	penetrates clouds.
spellbook of detect treasure
	Allows you to learn the spell of detect treasure.

	This spell has the same effect as a potion of object detection.

	Unskilled or Basic: Same effect as quaffing an uncursed potion of
	object detection.

	Skilled or Expert: Same effect as quaffing a blessed potion of
	object detection.
spellbook of clairvoyance
	Allows you to learn the spell of clairvoyance.

	When cast, the spell magically maps a 19x11 area centered on your
	location. It also detects objects and presence of monsters in the
	mapped area. At Unskilled or Basic, monsters are marked with an I
	glyph, and objects are described in general ("a scroll", "a wand",
	etc.). At Skilled or above, monsters and objects will be shown as
	if you have seen them. If you have another source of clairvoyance,
	the spell will always be cast as Skilled.

	The spell is blocked if you are wearing a cornuthaum and are not a
	Wizard. Unlike the clairvoyance provided by aligned priests and
	some items in HackEM, the clairvoyance spell only maps once per
	cast, and does not persist as a recurring effect.
spellbook of enlighten
	Allows you to learn the spell of enlighten.

	It is equivalent to the wand of enlightenment, which lets you see
	your properties and exercise wisdom.
spellbook of identify
	Allows you to learn the spell of identify.

	Casting this spell at Basic or lower skill level is equivalent to
	an uncursed scroll of identify, identifying 1 item 84% of the time
	and identifying 2, 3, 4, or all items 4% of the time each. At
	Skilled or higher level, it works the same as a blessed scroll and
	identifies 1d4 items 80% of the time, and will identify your
	entire inventory 20% of the time. With positive Luck, a Skilled or
	higher casting will always identify at least 2 items.
spellbook of magic mapping
	Allows you to learn the spell of magic mapping.

	The spell reveals the entire map (although it does not fully
	reveal the contents of rooms), the same as an uncursed scroll of
	magic mapping; all of the level's walls and corridors, as well as
	all staircases on the level are shown. Secret passages are
	revealed, but secret doors are not.

	The spell will also reveal the current location of the magic
	portal on the Plane of Water if the player has formally located it
	before using confused gold detection or a crystal ball.
spellbook of healing
	Allows you to learn the spell of healing.

	Healing is a directional spell that heals its target(s) for 6d4 HP
	and, at Skilled or higher, cures blindness. This will awaken a
	sleeping monster without angering it. The effect is similar to an
	uncursed potion of healing, except that the spell cannot increase
	maximum HP.

	Casting this spell at a tame or peaceful monster will yield an
	alignment bonus for each monster affected, even if it was already
	at maximum HP; Lawfuls and Healers gain one alignment point, while
	chaotics besides Healers lose one point.

	Pestilence will actually take 3d4 damage from the spell of healing,
	with the damage halved due to his guaranteed monster magic
	resistance.

	Zapping zombies with this spell will instead do damage to them.
spellbook of cure blindness
	Allows you to learn the spell of cure blindness.

	Casting this spell simply cures intrinsic blindness.
spellbook of extra healing
	Allows you to learn the spell of extra healing.

	Extra healing is a directional spell that heals its target(s) for
	6d8 HP and cures blindness; the spell will awaken a sleeping
	monster without angering it. The effect is similar to an uncursed
	potion of extra healing, though it cannot increase maximum HP and
	will not cure your own hallucination or sickness if you cast it at
	yourself.

	Casting this spell at a tame or peaceful monster will yield an
	alignment bonus for each monster affected, even if it was already
	at maximum HP. Lawfuls and Healers gain one alignment point, while
	chaotic non-healers lose one point.

	Pestilence will actually take 3d8 damage from the spell, with the
	damage halved due to his guaranteed monster magic resistance.

    Zapping zombies with this spell will instead do damage to them.

	Despite code that sets a flag to allow for different effects when
	cast at Skilled or higher, there is no actual difference in effect:
	the implementation of the spell effect cures blindness, regardless
	of the flag.
spellbook of restore ability
	Allows you to learn the spell of restore ability.

	Casting this spell has the same effect as a potion of restore
	ability, except that it does not restore lost levels. At less than
	skilled in healing spells, it restores one random lost attribute
	of strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, or
	charisma to its previous maximum amount, like an uncursed potion.
	At skilled or expert, it restores all six attributes like a
	blessed potion.
spellbook of stone to flesh
	Allows you to learn the spell of stone to flesh.

	The spell of stone to flesh has many effects depending on what
	stone object(s) it is used on.

	Statues of monsters are brought to life; tame pets turned to stone
	will be restore it to their original state. Additionally, if the
	monster is smaller than medium size and/or not fleshy, the statue
	will be turned into a single meatball instead. If the statue is of
	a unique monster or a quest guardian, it will reanimate as a
	disguised doppelganger instead of the real creature, unless the
	statue was created by stoning that creature.

	If the reanimation fails (usually because the creature is of a
	genocided species), the statue will be transformed into an
	appropriate corpse if possible, or remain unchanged if that
	monster cannot leave a corpse.

	A statue of a stone golem that has stone to flesh cast on it will
	only leave behind a single meatball; an animated stone golem will
	instead become a flesh golem.

	Casting stone to flesh on a boulder turns it into a huge chunk of
	meat; rocks, gray stones, and valuable non-glass gems become
	meatballs. A ring made of mineral or gemstone material becomes a
	meat ring; a marble wand becomes a meat stick.

	When cast on yourself or other monsters, any ongoing stiffening
	process is cancelled, and any susceptible items in open inventory
	are transformed as well.
spellbook of cure sickness
	Allows you to learn the spell of cure sickness.

	When cast, the spell cures all forms of sickness, including food
	poisoning and illness, and removes slime.
spellbook of create monster
	Allows you to learn the spell of create monster.

	When cast, it has a 72/73 chance of creating a single monster or
	horde, and a 1/73 chance of creating 2-5 miscellaneous monsters,
	as with an uncursed scroll of create monster. The monsters will
	almost always have a difficulty level at or below your current
	level, and a monsters normally generated in groups (such as orcs
	or ants) will count as a single monster for the purposes of this
	spell. The monsters may be peaceful with the normal probability,
	but will never be tame; this is not a "create pet" spell.
spellbook of remove curse
	Allows you to learn the spell of remove curse.

	When cast at Basic level or lower, the spell of remove curse acts
	identically to an uncursed scroll of remove curse. At Skilled or
	higher, it is identical to a blessed scroll.
spellbook of turn undead
	Allows you to learn the spell of turn undead.

	The spell has the same effect as the wand of undead turning:
	casting it creates a beam which deals 1d8 damage to undead
	monsters it hits (doubled for a knight with the Magic Mirror of
	Merlin), and scares them into fleeing if they fail a resistance
	check. It also has the ability to "unturn dead", which revives
	corpses and rejuvenates eggs.
spellbook of create familiar
	Allows you to learn the spell of create familiar.

	This spell creates a monster near you. It has a 1/3 chance of
	creating an appropriate starting pet and a 2/3 chance of creating
	a random monster. The created monster will be tame, if it is
	tameable, and made peaceful otherwise.

	Monsters that are traitorous or untameable will never be created
	by this spell.
spellbook of protection
	Allows you to learn the spell of protection

	Casting this spell decreases your AC temporarily; the exact
	reduction depends on:
	- your experience level,
	- the amount of protection already gained from this spell,
	- and your AC before casting the spell.

	The protection wears off at a rate of 1 point every 10 turns, or 1
	point every 20 turns if the spell was cast with expert proficiency.

	or seemed likely to fall from off the bridge.  Now and then
	they stopped to rest, and each thought that he never had seen
	in all his life before such a hand at quarterstaff.  At last
	Robin gave the stranger a blow upon the ribs that made his
	jacket smoke like a damp straw thatch in the sun.  So shrewd
	was the stroke that the stranger came within a hair's breadth
	of falling off the bridge; but he regained himself right
	quickly, and, by a dexterous blow, gave Robin a crack on the
	crown that caused the blood to flow.  Then Robin grew mad
	with anger, and smote with all his might at the other; but
	the stranger warded the blow, and once again thwacked Robin,
	and this time so fairly that he fell heels over head into the
	water, as the queen pin falls in a game of bowls.

	realized that with all his effort he was no closer to the top

	bottom.  But he struggled on for a while longer, until at last,
	completely exhausted, he collapsed onto one of the steps.
	"I should have known it," he mumbled, resting his tired legs
	and filling his lungs with air.  "This is just like the line
	that goes on forever, and I'll never get there."

	Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so
	still - for it hadn't moved one inch since he first set eyes

	the shadow of the arch as much as he could.  He now saw from
	the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
	looking at him at all.  ("But supposing it turns its head?"
	thought Edmund.)  In fact it was staring at something else -
	namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about
	four feet away.  "Aha!" thought Edmund.  "When it springs at
	the dwarf then will be my chance to escape."  But still the
	lion never moved, nor did the dwarf.  And now at last Edmund
	remembered what the others had said about the White Witch
	turning people into stone.  Perhaps this was only a stone
	lion.  And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that
	the lion's back and the top of its head were covered with

stethoscope
	The stethoscope is a tool that appears in NetHack, and is used to
	determine the status of a monster and listen to dungeon acoustics.

	The stethoscope can be applied in any direction, including up,
	down, or at yourself; stethoscopes require a free hand to use, and
	will not function while you are deaf. Applying it to a monster
	will show you their name, alignment, experience level, hit points,
	armor class, and miscellaneous attributes of the target.

	When applied to yourself, it displays your experience level, HP,
	and AC, an accurate appraisal of your alignment record, and many
	different properties.

	The stethoscope's use is free once per action, meaning that it
	doesn't count as your action for that turn; applying one twice in
	a row will increment the turn counter, and this does not stack with
	multiple stethoscopes. A cursed stethoscope has a 50% chance of
	just sounding your own heartbeat.

	Applying a stethoscope to a tile with a secret door reveals it;
	this does not exercise wisdom. Applying a stethoscope in certain
	other scenarios may produce YAFM.

	A stethoscope can be used to open an iron safe and may also be
	used to identify an egg.

	dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of
	anyone else, made a great difference to Mr. Baggins.  He felt
	a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of
	an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put
	it back into its sheath.
	"I will give you a name," he said to it, "and I shall call

	There were sounds in the distance, incongruent with the

	yet the ship followed them, as if drawn by them; they grew
	louder - pain and despair were there, but terror was
	predominant.
	Elric had heard such sounds echoing from his cousin Yyrkoon's
	sardonically named 'Pleasure Chambers' in the days before he
	had fled the responsibilities of ruling all that remained of
	the old Melnibonean Empire.  These were the voices of men
	whose very souls were under siege; men to whom death meant
	not mere extinction, but a continuation of existence, forever
	in thrall to some cruel and supernatural master.  He had

	Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure
	was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also
	been stuffed with straw.  On the feet were some old boots with

	figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of the
	pole stuck up its back.

striped shirt
    A type of shirt added in the Convict Patch, and found in all
    variants that include the Convict role. Convicts begin the game
    wearing a cursed striped shirt as a prison uniform.

    The striped shirt is equivalent to the existing shirts, the T-shirt
    and Hawaiian shirt. It can be worn under regular torso armor.

    What makes this shirt different from the others is that if a
    shopkeeper sees you wearing an uncovered striped shirt, (s)he
    will conclude that you are a fugitive from the law and will not
    merely hike up prices, as with the other shirts, but will actually
    stand in the doorway of the establishment, blocking entry:
        "I don't serve your kind here."

    This will only happen if there is a worn, uncovered striped shirt.
    Shopkeepers will not notice shirts under torso armor or a cloak,
    and they will not object if a scruffy visitor tries to sell
    them something that looks suspiciously like a discarded prison
    uniform. However, shopkeepers who have seen a customer in stripes
    even once will remember the sight and continue to refuse access,
     even after the customer removes the shirt or covers it up.

    In UnNetHack, black marketeer One-eyed Sam is an exception: if she
    sees a customer wearing a striped shirt, she will reduce her prices.

tin
tin of *
	A tin is a type of permafood that does not rot as time passes,
	although it may take some time to eat unless you have a way to
	quickly open it.

	Randomly generated tins have a 1 in 6 (16.7%) chance of containing
	spinach, and the rest will contain the meat of a monster that can
	randomly appear on the current level, with standard probabilities
	and the exception of corpseless monsters and wraiths. Tins can
	also be made by applying a tinning kit to a corpse; tins of spinach
	cannot be created this way. Tins containing the meat of genocided
	monsters are not randomly generated, and any tins made or wished
	for will be empty instead; tins of unique monsters cannot be
	wished for.

	If the tin is generated as part of a health food store, it will
	always contain either spinach or a vegetarian monster; if the
	initial random tin contents are not vegetarian, it will be
	converted to spinach, making the odds of finding spinach in health
	food stores much higher than normal.

	Random tins are normally generated 90% uncursed, 5% cursed and 5%
	blessed.

	Opening
	When you attempt to eat a tin, you first try to open it.

	If you are polymorphed into a metallivore, you open it immediately.
	Otherwise, if you are a monster with no limbs, or a very small
	monster, eating a tin is impossible. Otherwise, if the tin is
	blessed, it takes 0-1 turns to open it (always 0 turns if you also
	wield a blessed tin opener).

	Otherwise, the time depends on what you wield:
	A tin opener opens it quickly depending on its BUC status:
		- 0 turns if blessed,
		- 0-1 turns if uncursed,
		- 0-2 turns if cursed.

	A wielded knife, crysknife, stiletto, athame, or any kind of
	dagger will open it in 3 turns. A pick-axe or an axe (but not a
	battle-axe or dwarvish mattock) will open it in 6 turns. If you are
	wielding none of the above and have slippery fingers, the tin
	slips from your fingers.

	Otherwise, you will take between 10 and 10 + 500/(Str+Dex) turns
	to open it. If it takes 50 or more turns, you "give up your attempt
	to open the tin." Because this can take so long, and because many
	tins end up containing less than 100 nutrition, you may not
	actually gain any net nutrition from eating tins if you cannot open
	them quickly.

	Randomly generated tins may explode 1/8 of the time if they are
	cursed when they are being opened. The explosion has the same
	effects as an exploding door, and it destroys the tin.

	Once you have opened the tin, its preparation method is determined
	(unless it is spinach, which doesn't have a preparation method).
	The possible preparation methods are "deep fried", "pickled", "soup
	made from", "pureed", "rotten", "homemade", "stir fried", "candied",
	"boiled", "dried", "szechuan", "french fried", "sauteed", "broiled",
	and "smoked". This determines the amount of nutrition the tin provides.

	If you made the tin with a tinning kit, tins of lizard and lichen
	are always homemade, while blessed/uncursed/cursed tins of other
	monsters have a chance of 0, 1/7 and 1 of being rotten, otherwise
	they are homemade.

	For randomly generated tins:
	- cursed tins of lizard and lichen are always homemade
	- other cursed tins are always rotten
	- noncursed tins of lizard and lichen are never rotten; they have
	  a 2/15 chance of being homemade and a 1/15 chance of each other method
	- other uncursed tins have 1/15 chance of being each method except
	  rotten or homemade, 6/105 chance of being homemade, and 8/105
	  chance of being rotten

	Since the type of preparation is determined only after you open
	the tin, there is no way to know it in advance, and tins that
	stack may end up being of different styles.

	Eating:
	If the tin is empty (because its monster type is genocided or
	extinct), it is discarded. Non-cursed tins of spinach will
	increase your strength, while cursed ones decrease your strength.

	Most non-spinach tins have low nutritional value (see below), but
	tins of pureed monster have nutritional value 500, which is more
	than half that of a food ration.

	Eating a deep fried, french fried, or stir fried tin will give you
	slippery fingers and cause you to drop your weapon. It is therefore
	unwise to eat tins in a shop without first unwielding your weapon.

	Rotten tins provide no nutrition points (eating them makes you
	neither more nor less hungry), and make you nauseated. Unless you
	cure the nausea, you vomit, losing 20 nutritional points.

	Eating the tin, after it is opened, takes one turn.

	Corpses that convey intrinsics will have the same probability of
	conferring that intrinsic when they have been tinned. Tinning makes
	poisonous and rotten corpses safe, however, as your character picks
	out the good bits for the tin that they can fit inside. It is
	popular to tin dragons and giants, as you will still get the
	intrinsic / strength increase, but without the enormous meal.

tin opener
	You can only apply a tin opener if you have at least one tin in
	your inventory - doing so will prompt you to choose which tin you
	then want to open and eat. You can also wield it before manually
	opening the tin via e. Wielding a tin opener by applying it will
	not take up an additional turn if you immediately open a tin when
	prompted. Though a tin opener is not a weapon or weapon-tool, a
	cursed one will weld to the player's hand when wielded.

	Opening a tin with this tool will do so quickly regardless of the
	tin's BUC status. The exact number of turns required to open a tin
	depends on the BUC status of the tin opener: 0-2 turns if cursed,
	0 or 1 turns if uncursed, and 0 turns if blessed.

	A lit torch does fire damage to monsters. A new torch can stay lit

	cold. It also has a chance of destroying potions, scrolls or spell-
	books in the monster's inventory.

	To light a torch, apply it with a. (Unlike in SlashEM, torches do
	not require wielding to light.) To extinguish a wielded lit torch,
	either apply it again, or wield something else. You can't keep a
	lit torch in your pack; you will automatically extinguish the torch.
	However, you can drop or throw a lit torch, and it will stay lit.
	By dropping a lit torch, you can enjoy its light while you wield a
	better weapon.

towel
wet towel
moist towel
	The towel is a multipurpose tool. You can put on a towel using P
	and blind yourself, then R to remove it and see again.

	You can also apply the towel for multiple purposes:

	If your fingers are slippery, you can apply a noncursed towel to
	wipe them off so you can wield a weapon again.

	If you are blind because of a cream pie or blinding venom, you can
	apply a noncursed towel to clean your face and unblind yourself.
	(If you remain blind for another reason, "Your face feels clean
	now.") Unlike the #wipe command, a towel cleans your face in one
	turn.

	Applying a cursed towel will instead make your fingers slippery or
	else blind you by gunking up your face.

	You can also engrave with a towel; you will not actually write
	anything, but you will erase anything written with dust, blood, or
	even magic marker.

	You can no longer wear a towel in a form with no head.

	You can also wet a towel through various methods. The wetness
	level is an integer between 0 and 7. The appearance of the towel
	gives an indication of the wetness level of the towel; the exact
	wetness is only shown in wizard mode. A towel can be made wet by
	any source of water, including an uncursed potion of water or a
	rust trap. This will add 1-7 levels of wetness, to the maximum of
	7.

	When wielded as a weapon, a wet towel will deal between 1 and
	(wetness) damage, capped at 6 damage. There is additionally a
	(wetness) in (wetness+1) chance of drying out, losing 1 point of
	wetness. Applying the towel, wiping out an engraving in the dust
	with the towel, or throwing the towel removes 1 point of wetness.

	V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
	beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world
	of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy
	River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it
	round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze
	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
	see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can
	wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of
	course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
	enough.

tripe
tripe ration
	Has a 50% chance of giving you nausea unless you are a Caveman,
	an orc or a non-humanoid carnivorous monster (e.g. a canine
	through lycanthropy); in those forms, you can eat it as a normal
	food.

	A tripe ration is considered a treat for carnivorous pets (like
	dogs and cats), and increases the pet's apport when fed to them.
	Throwing tripe to a hostile or peaceful cat or dog will tame it,
	as will other forms of meat save for corpses; carrying a tripe
	ration in your main inventory will make a carnivorous pet stick
	around closer to you.

	If you throw a tripe ration at a hostile horse, it will remain
	hostile.

	If you start from scratch, cooking tripe is a long-drawn-out
	affair.  Fresh whole tripe calls for a minimum of 12 hours of
	cooking, some time-honored recipes demanding as much as 24.
	To prepare fresh tripe, trim if necessary.  Wash it thoroughly,
	soaking overnight, and blanch, for 1/2 hour in salted water.
	Wash well again, drain and cut for cooking.  When cooked, the
	texture of tripe should be like that of soft gristle.  More

honu
*turtle
	The most popular Hawaiian turtle legend is that of Kauila.
	Historian Daniel Akaka, Jr. tells the story this way:

	This takes place on the island of Hawai'i at a black sand beach
	called Punalu'u.  Two turtles, the female named Honupo'okea
	(White-headed Green Sea Turtle) and the male named Honu'ea
	(Hawksbill), entered the beach of Punalu'u and dug out a pond
	which provided the people of the area with a supply of drinking
	water.  Honupo'okea left a nest of eggs and when they hatched,
	all but one of the hatchlings entered the sea and that one
	hatchling lived in the nearby pond.  The people named the baby
	turtle Kauila, for her shell was the color of a dark-brown natice
	hardwood of that name.  This female turtle grew in the pond and
	was known to possess special powers.  She could transform herself
	into a little girl and would often be seen on the beach with the
	other children.  When children were caught in the strong ocean
	currents while swimming she would go out and save them.  When
	Kauila wanted to retire back to her home pond she would once again
	transform back into her turtle form.  The people of Punalu'u loved
	Kauila as the guardian of their children and also for the spring
	that gave them pure drinking water.
		[ Fire in the Turtle House, by Osha Gray Davidson ]

	Through the fathomless deeps of space swims the star turtle Great
	A'Tuin, bearing on its back the four giant elephants who carry on
	their shoulders the mass of the Discworld. A tiny sun and moon spin
	around them, on a complicated orbit to induce seasons, so probably
	nowhere else in the multiverse is it sometimes necessary for an
	elephant to cock a leg to allow the sun to go past.
	Exactly why this should be may never be known. Possibly the Creator
	of the universe got bored with all the usual business of axial
	inclination, albedos and rotational velocities, and decided to have
	a bit of fun for once.

two-handed sword
    The Zweihänder (German 'two-hander'), also Doppelhänder ('double-
    hander'), Beidhänder ('both-hander'), Bihänder or Bidenhänder, is a
    large two-handed sword primarily in use during the 16th century.

    Crafting recipe: two-handed sword = long sword + broadsword

guide
	"Rincewind!"
	Twoflower sprang off the bed.  The wizard jumped back,
	wrenching his features into a smile.
	"My dear chap, right on time!  We'll just have lunch, and
	then I'm sure you've got a wonderful programme lined up for
	this afternoon!"
	"Er --"
	"That's great!"
	Rincewind took a deep breath.  "Look," he said desperately,
	"let's eat somewhere else.  There's been a bit of a fight
	down below."
	"A tavern brawl?  Why didn't you wake me up?"
	"Well, you see, I - _what_?"
	"I thought I made myself clear this morning, Rincewind.  I
	want to see genuine Morporkian life - the slave market, the
	Whore Pits, the Temple of Small Gods, the Beggar's Guild...
	and a genuine tavern brawl."  A faint note of suspicion
	entered Twoflower's voice.  "You _do_ have them, don't you?
	You know, people swinging on chandeliers, swordfights over
	the table, the sort of thing Hrun the Barbarian and the
	Weasel are always getting involved in.  You know --
	_excitement_."

tymora
	Tymora, the goddess of good fortune, smiles on risk-takers,
	the reckless and foolhardy, and other charming ne'er-do-wells.
	Born from the cleaving in two of the luck goddess Tyche, she is
	frequently locked in struggle with her twin sister Beshaba,
	goddess of ill fortune.
tyr
	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:
	he is most daring, and best in stoutness of heart, and he
	has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for
	men of valor to invoke him.  It is a proverb, that he is
	Tyr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver.
	He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
	is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
	Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
	the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
	until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But
	when the Aesir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand
	at the place now called 'the wolf's joint;' and Tyr is one-
	handed, and is not called a reconciler of men.

*hulk
	Umber hulks are powerful subterranean predators whose
	iron-like claws allow them to burrow through solid stone in
	search of prey.  They are tremendously strong; muscles bulge
	beneath their thick, scaly hides and their powerful arms and
	legs all end in great claws.
*unicorn
~unicorn horn
	Men have always sought the elusive unicorn, for the single
	twisted horn which projected from its forehead was thought to
	be a powerful talisman.  It was said that the unicorn had
	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water
	to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.
	Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was
	used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very
	fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single
	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be
	tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a
	virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and
	in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.
		[ Mythical Beasts, by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]

	Martin took a small sip of beer.  "Almost ready," he said.
	"You hold your beer awfully well."
	Tlingel laughed.  "A unicorn's horn is a detoxicant.  Its
	possession is a universal remedy.  I wait until I reach the
	warm glow stage, then I use my horn to burn off any excess and
	keep me right there."
		[ Unicorn Variations, by Roger Zelazny ]
unicorn horn
	The unicorn horn, sometimes called a unihorn, is a weapon-tool.

	Unicorn horns are not randomly generated and can only be obtained
	by killing a unicorn, which leaves an uncursed +0 unicorn horn
	behind if killed in a way that leaves a corpse. Horns obtained
	from normal unicorns are considered magical items. Revived or
	polymorphed unicorns only have a 50% chance of leaving one upon
	death; the rest of the time, its horn will crumble to dust.

	As a weapon, the unicorn horn has a dedicated weapon skill which
	only it uses.

	As a tool, applying a noncursed unicorn horn can cure multiple
	negative status properties:	Blindness (non-physical),Deafness,
	Confusion, Hallucination, Stunning, Sickness, Nausea

	A unicorn horn cannot cure: Stoning, Sliming, Lycanthropy, Wounded
	legs, Amnesia, Fear

	Applying an uncursed unicorn horn will fix (d(2d2) - 1) ailments,
	whilst a blessed one can heal (d(2d4) - 1) ailments. A cursed
	unicorn horn will instead cause one or more of the applicable
	ailments listed above. If you are wearing a ring of sustain
	ability, a unicorn horn will not affect your attributes. When used
	by an intelligent monster with hands, noncursed unicorn horns are
	guaranteed to work on the first try; monsters will not use cursed
	unicorn horns.

	Dipping a noncursed unicorn horn into certain potions can "cure"
	them as well: dipping one into a potion of sickness changes it to
	a potion of fruit juice, and dipping one into a potion of
	blindness, confusion, or hallucination will turn it into a potion
	of water.

	Unicorns can use their own horn, as can a player polymorphed into
	a unicorn via the #monster; these produce the same effect as
	applying an uncursed unicorn horn.

	Note: Unicorn horns can no longer restore reduced attributes.
	Alternatives include potions of restore ability, the restore
	ability spell, prayer, or gain ability.

	Cursed unicorn horns also no longer reduce attributes. Instead,
	they can induce nausea; currently, this gives no message.

~vampire bat
vampire*
	He can transform himself to wolf, as we gather from the ship
	arrival in Whitby, when he tear open the dog; he can be as
	bat, as Madam Mina saw him on the window at Whitby, and as
	friend John saw him fly from this so near house, and as my
	friend Quincey saw him at the window of Miss Lucy. He can come
	in mist which he create--that noble ship's captain proved him
	of this; but, from what we know, the distance he can make this
	mist is limited, and it can only be round himself. He come on
	moonlight rays as elemental dust--as again Jonathan saw those
	sisters in the castle of Dracula. He become so small--we
	ourselves saw Miss Lucy, ere she was at peace, slip through a
	hairbreadth space at the tomb door.
		[ Dracula, by Bram Stoker ]

	The Oxford English Dictionary is quite unequivocal:
	_vampire_ - "a preternatural being of a malignant nature (in
	the original and usual form of the belief, a reanimated
	corpse), supposed to seek nourishment, or do harm, by sucking
	the blood of sleeping persons. ..."
		[]
vampire mage
	Real terror is not the sight of death, it is the fear of death.
	What is the fear of death? Terror of the unknown. Is it these
	eyes you peer into? No, I am not the unknown. You an I are closer
	kin than you and it were.

~eye of vecna
~hand of vecna
vecna
	Vecna's early life was clouded in legend and contradiction.
	Most accounts stated that he was originally a human wizard
	from Oerth, although some reports claimed that he was a half-elf.
	After having become an extremely powerful wizard and starting to
	fear for his own mortality, Vecna was taught by Orcus how to
	achieve undeath, later becoming one of the most powerful liches
	ever in existence.

	During his reign, Vecna trusted his lieutenant Kas with most
	administrative tasks.  He forged the powerful Sword of Kas as an
	instrument of his lieutenant's authority.  However, Vecna's evil,
	manifested in the sword, seduced Kas into usurping and killing his
	master.
venus
	Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, was the daughter of
	Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from the
	foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to
	the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by
	the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All
	were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her
	for his wife.  Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for
	the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So
	the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the
	most ill-favoured of gods.

vlad*
	Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the
	Birgau region of the Carpathian Mountains, in what is now
	Romania.  In Romanian history he is best known for two things.
	One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept
	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling
	them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who
	failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.
vorpal*
	The Cat materialized at the far end of the bar, downed the
	Hatter's drink, and said, "I hear the burbling, and eyes of
	flame are drifting to the left."
	I glanced at the mural, and I, too, saw the fiery eyes and heard
	a peculiar sound.
	"It could be any number of things," Luke remarked.
	The Cat moved to a rack behind the bar and reached high up on
	the wall to where a strange weapon hung, shimmering and shifting
	in shadow. He lowered the thing and slid it along the bar; it came
	to rest before Luke.
	"Better have the Vorpal Sword in hand, that's all I can say."
	Luke laughed, but I stared fascinated at the device which looked
	as if it were made of moth wings and folded moonlight.

*vortex
vortices
	Swirling clouds of pure elemental energies, the vortices are
	thought to be related to the larger elementals.  Though most
	vortices do no damage when touched, they are noted for being
	able to envelop unwary travellers. The hapless fool thus
	swallowed by a vortex will soon perish from exposure to the
	element the vortex is composed of.
voulge
	Place a hefty cleaver at the end of a long, stout shaft, and
	the leverage which the pole gives the wielder will enable him
	to cleave through armor. The voulge has no provision to keep
	the enemy at a distance in its basic model, but with the top
	front or back edge is ground down so as to provide a pointed,
	dagger-like tip, the weapon assumes a more complete form.
vrock
	The vrock is one of the weaker forms of demon.  It resembles
	a cross between a human being and a vulture and does physical
	damage by biting and by using the claws on both its arms and
	feet.
wakizashi
	A wakizashi was used as a samurai's weapon when the katana
	was unavailable.  When entering a building, a samurai would
	leave his katana on a rack near the entrance.  However, the
	wakizashi would be worn at all times, and therefore, it made
	a sidearm for the samurai (similar to a soldier's use of a
	pistol).  The samurai would have worn it from the time they
	awoke to the time they went to sleep.  In earlier periods,
	and especially during times of civil wars, a tanto was worn
	in place of a wakizashi.
		[ Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ]
wand of corrosion
	Shoots an acidic ray, similar to a yellow dragon's breath attack.
	- The acid ray deals 6d6 acid damage to monsters that don't
	  resist acid.
	- Can corrode iron and copper weapons and armor.
	- Can also destroy doors and melt iron bars.
	- Being hit by the acid ray will cure stoning.

	Zap self:
	- You take 12d6 damage, unless you have acid resistance.
	- Your items are also subject to acid damage.

	Breaking:
	- Causes an acid explosion which deals (12 x charges) damage.
	- A Magic Beam Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The
	  more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating a trap.

	Engraving: Burn.
wand of cancellation
	Emits a beam which cancels any monsters or objects it hits.
	Monsters are entitled to a resistance check against the effect.

	The wand of cancellation has a number of complicated effects.
	Among these effects, it will:
	    - uncurse and unbless items
	    - neutralize enchantments and charges of most items
	    - change most potions into water; sickness and see invisible
	      into fruit juice; booze and oil just become uncursed
	    - blank scrolls and spellbooks
	    - neutralize the special attacks of many monsters
	    - kill a clay golem instantly by erasing its writing

	Putting a charged wand of cancellation (or a bag containing a
	wand of cancellation) into a bag of holding will cause a magical
	explosion that will destroy the bag and scatter its contents in
	a roughly 10 by 10 area. Breakable items are subject to breakage
	from the force of the explosion.

	Zapping a bag of holding, however, will either unbless or uncurse
	it, and will have no effect on the contents.

	Zapping self: You will cancel all items carried in your inventory
	  (except wands of cancellation).

	Breaking:
	- Cause an explosion that deals 1 to (4 x charges) damage and also
	  cancels all monsters and objects in a 3x3 square around you.
	  An Anti-Magic Trap may be created when this wand is broken.
	  The more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating the trap.

	Engraving: Dust
	- Engraving over a writing in the dust gives the message "The
	  engraving on the <floor> vanishes!" This can be either a wand
	  of cancellation, make invisible, or teleportation.
wand of cold
	Zapping the wand in a given direction emits a ray of ice.
	- Deals 6d6 damage to non-cold resistant targets, with a +6d3 bonus
	  if the monster has fire resistance.
	- Monsters hit have a 1/3 chance of any potions in their
	  inventory freezing and shattering.

	Effects:
	- The ray bounces when it hits walls or targets with reflection;
	  it will also freeze any moat of water it travels over into ice,
	  and lava is cooled and solidified into normal rock.
	- Destroys doors

	Zapping self:
	- You take 12d6 damage, depending on how much cold resistance you
	  have. Your items are also subject to cold damage.

	Breaking:
	- Creates an explosion of cold dealing (8 x charges) damage.
	  An Ice Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The more
	  charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating the trap.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- Engraving over a burned engraving will make it vanish.
wand of create horde
	Zapping or engraving with it creates 4-11 monsters.

	- When a monster zaps it, creates 6-10 monsters.

	Breaking:
	- Creates an explosion dealing (8 x charges) damage and creates
	  monsters around you.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of create monster
	Zapping or engraving with it creates:
	- one monster (22/23 chance)
	- or 2-9 monsters (1/23 chance)

	- the monster level of each will be consistent with what is
	  normally created.
	- Even in the former case, a group of monsters may be created
	  if that monster often appears in large groups, such as hill orcs.

	Breaking:
	- Creates an explosion causing from 1 to (4 x charges) damage and
	  surrounds the player with monsters.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of death
	Zapping it in any direction fires a ray of death that instantly
	kills almost any monster it hits in its path, including the player.
	- As with all ray-type wands, it can rebound, and there is a
	  chance that it will miss.

	- Death, all major demons, all nonliving monsters, and monsters
	  with player-type magic resistance are completely unaffected;
	  Death in particular will actually be healed and become stronger.
	- Conversely, Pestilence and Famine are still susceptible.
	- Having reflection will prevent instant-death, but monsters/
	players will still take damage from the ray.

	- Wands of death can be recharged only once.

	Zapping self:
	- Zapping a wand of death directly at yourself results in
	  instadeath, even if you have magic resistance or reflection
	  — unless you are polymorphed into any of the unaffected
	  monsters mentioned above.

	Breaking:
	- Creates a magical explosion that deals (16 x charges) damage;
	  although referred to as a "death field" in the associated
	  message, magic resistance is not necessary to survive this
	  explosion.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of digging
	Zapping in a given direction produces a ray that can dig open a
	corridor of several squares through solid rock and walls,
	destroying any doors in its path; the ray has no effect on
	boulders.

	- Zapping upward causes a rock to fall from the ceiling and bonk
	  you on the head unless you are underwater.
	- Zapping downward creates a hole, and doing this on an
	  undiggable floor creates a pit. Unless you are levitating,
	  flying, or else happen to escape, you will fall in. Doing so on
	  a headstone always creates a pit on the square and unearths the
	  contents of that grave.
	- Zapping the wand in a maze level now works as it normally would
	  (no longer restricted to 1 square)
	- Zapping a boulder will vaporize it.
	- the ray has no effect on undiggable walls and rock.

	- Zapping the wand while being engulfed by a non-whirly monster
	  halves the monster's current HP and expels you.
	- Rays from a wand of digging will also halve the current HP of
	  "stony" monsters, including xorns, earth elementals, gargoyles
	  and stone golems.
	- Razing the walls and/or doors of Minetown will anger the watch.

	Breaking:
	- Creates an explosion causing from 1 to (4 x charges) damage.
	  Creates pits or holes on your square and the eight squares
	  around you, with the exception of undiggable floors and stairs,
	  boulders or traps. This can also destroy altars and thrones.
	  Any liquid will immediately flow in and fill the pits and holes.

	Engraving: Engraving type.
	- Any text engraved with a wand of digging is as durable as text
	  engraved with a weapon or hard gem - this makes it as effective
	  as an athame and slightly less effective than a wand of fire or
	  lightning for engraving Elbereth.
wand of draining
	Casts an unreflectable beam which drains a level from its target
	monster. Like the spellbook, it also drains enchantment (one point
	at a time) from armor and weapons, and charges from rings, wands,
	and chargeable tools.

	- The only protection against these wands is drain resistance.

	Zapping self: You lose a level unless you possess Drain Resistance.

	Breaking:
	- Creates an explosion dealing (8 x charges) damage; anything
	  caught in the explosion loses a level and objects are also
	  subject to draining.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- When engraved with, if there is a pre-existing message, it will
	  erase part, or possibly all, of it. This generally produces the
	  message "The engraving looks different now" which is shared with
	  the wand of polymorph.  If the pre-existing engraving is
      sufficiently short, the wand will instead give a message about
      the engraving disappearing; to avoid this ambiguity with the
      other wands that do that, dust-engrave moderately long messages
      before engrave-testing unidentified wands.
wand of enlightenment
	Zapping this wand grants you enlightenment: you see your properties
	and exercise wisdom.

	Breaking: No effects.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of extra healing
	Zapping yourself:
	- Heals 6d8 HP, up to the maximum.
	- Cures hallucination, blindness, and deafness.
	- If not cursed, this also cures sickness.
	- Exercises strength and constitution.

	Zapping a monster:
	- Heals 5d4 HP, +10 if the wand is blessed or cursed.
	- This means that a cursed wand of extra healing is more potent
	  than an uncursed wand.
	- If not cursed, cures a monster's sickness.
	- If zapped at a zombie, it instead inflicts damage equal.

	Breaking: No effects.

	Engraving: Dust. Shares the same message as a wand of healing:
	  "The bugs on the floor look healthier!"
wand of fear
	When zapped or engraved with, this wand scares monsters around
	you in a similar fashion to reading a scroll of scare monster.

	cursed:
	-  If monsters are fleeing, they stop.
	- If monsters are paralyzed or sleeping, they wake up and are
	able to move.
	- 80% of the time a cursed wand zaps you with fear as well.

	Breaking:
	- When broken, the explosion does no damage but instead scares
	  you for 5-15 turns.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of fire
	Zapping the wand in a given direction emits a ray of fire which
	deals 6d6 damage to non-fire resistant targets, with a +7 bonus
	if the monster has cold resistance.

	- Monsters/players hit with this ray may have their inventory set
	  aflame: potions may boil, scrolls and spellbooks may burn, and
	  organic armor may smoulder.
	- The ray bounces when it hits walls or targets with reflection;
	- It can melt any squares of ice it travels over, destroy any
	  doors it collides with and evaporates pools of water.

	In an emergency where you are afflicted with sliming, zapping the
	wand at yourself can save you.

	Breaking:
	- Results in an explosion dealing from 1 to (4 x charges) damage.
	- A Fire Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The more
	  charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating the trap.

	Engraving: Burn.
	- A popular means of engraving Elbereth - such engravings are
	  permanent and can only be removed by magical means.
wand of healing
	- Zapping yourself will heal 5d6 HP, up to the maximum and will
	  exercise strength.
	- If not cursed, this cures blindness and deafness.
	- If blessed, also cures sickness.

	- Zapping a monster will heal 5d2 HP, +5 if the wand is blessed
	  or cursed(a cursed wand is more potent than an uncursed wand.)
	- If not blessed, cures a monster's sickness.
	- If zapped at a zombie, it instead inflicts damage.

	Breaking: No effects.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- Shares the same message as a wand of extra healing:
	  "The bugs on the floor look healthier!"
wand of light
	- When zapped or engraved with, this wand lights an area with a
	  radius of 5.
	- If cursed however, the surrounding area will be darkened instead.

	Breaking:
	- Results in an explosion dealing from 1 to (4 x charges) damage,
	  with the hero being blinded for (n + 1)d25 turns, with n being the
	  number of remaining charges. The same area is lit as when the
	  wand is zapped; surrounding monsters may also be blinded, and
	  gremlins take damage.

	Engraving: Dust.

	Note: Unlike in EvilHack, this wand does not blind or anger
	peaceful monsters when zapped while they are in the radius of light.
wand of lightning
	Zapping the wand in a given direction shoots a ray of lightning.
	- Deals 6d6 damage to non-shock resistant targets;
	- also blinds targets in its line of fire for d50 (more) turns
	  with a cap of 127,
	- may also destroy any rings, wands or amulets in their inventory
	  unless they have reflection.
	- The ray bounces when it hits walls or targets with reflection;
	  being hit by a rebound will blind you for (ulevel / 2 + 1)d50
	  (more) turns.

	- Only the ring of shock resistance and the wand of lightning
	  itself are immune to destruction by shock damage (other sources
	  of shock damage include chest traps, a returning Mjollnir,
	  energy vortices or electric eels.)

	Zapping self:
	- You are blinded for 0-99 (more) turns in addition to the
	  normal shock damage.

	Breaking:
	- Creates an explosion that deals (16 x charges) damage to
	  yourself and all monsters on the surrounding squares. Your
	  inventory is subject to the same effects as though you were
	  zapped with the wand, i.e. your rings and wands may explode.
	- A Magic Beam Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The
	  more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating a trap.

	Engraving: Burn.
	- Like a wand of fire, this burns text into the ground; however,
	  doing so will blind you for d50 (more) turns. You can avoid
	  this by cancelling the prompt when asked what to engrave.
wand of locking
	A wand of locking will close and lock chests and doors.
	- If the door or the lock is broken, it will be repaired.
	- If the doorway has no door at all, a door will be created.
	  (If there is something in the doorway, the spell will not work.)
	- Drawbridges will be closed.

	- The effects of a wand of locking are the same as those of the
	  spellbook of wizard lock; see further information at wizard lock.

	Breaking: No effects.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of magic missile
	Zapping the wand in a given direction will do a fixed 2d6 damage
	to monsters in its path (unlike the spell of magic missile which
	will deal scaling damage with your skill and level).
	- the ray can rebound off walls and hit targets repeatedly.
	- Magic resistance negates this damage. Reflection partially
	  reduces this damage.

	Breaking:
	- Results in an explosion of magic missiles dealing (4 x charges)
	  damage. A Magic Trap may be created when this wand is broken.
     The more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating
     the trap.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of make invisible
	- Zapping this wand at a monster makes them invisible.
	- Zapping this wand at a peaceful monster will anger it.

	- If you zap yourself, you become invisible for:
	        (charges)d250 (more) turns.

	 - Zapping the wand downward will make any engraving on that
	   square disappear, as does engraving with it.

	Cursed wand of invisibility:
	- makes its target visible if already invisible,
	- has a 50% chance of aggravating monsters if zapped at yourself
	  while invisible.
	- If the target is visible, nothing happens.

	- Wearing a mummy wrapping protects against any effects from this
	  wand.

	Breaking:
	- Affects you and surrounding monsters with the zap effect
	  (dependent on beatitude).

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of nothing
	True to its name, the wand does absolutely nothing when zapped,
	engraved with, or broken by applying. Nevertheless, it has
	charges like any other wand.

	- A wand of nothing can either be non-directional, giving no
	  feedback whatsoever when zapped, or prompt for a direction,
	  then do nothing with it; each variant is equally likely.
	- The variant is randomly determined per-game, not per-item, so
	  if you find a non-directional wand of nothing, all other wands
	  of nothing in that game will also be non-directional. Whether
	  the wand is directional or not determines how many starting
	  charges it has (4-8 if directional, 11-15 if non-directional).

	- A wand of nothing is non-magical, and so doesn't lose its
	  charges to cancellation. As the only non-magical type of wand,
	  it will usually turn into a magical wand when polymorphed.

	- Note that the message "Nothing happens." isn't associated
	  specifically with the wand of nothing, but with any wand that's
	  out of charges. A wand of nothing only produces this message
	  when it happens to be out of charges.

	Engraving: Dust
wand of opening
	Can be used to unlock doors and containers, escape engulfing
	monsters, and remove punishment.
	- The effect is identical to that of the spell knock.

	On monsters:
	- Monster regurgitates the player if engulfed.
	- Removes monster's saddle, if worn, dropping it on the monster's
	  square (including your steed's saddle if you zap downward while
	  riding).
	- Regardless, if the zap strikes any monster, the monster does
	  not necessarily get an immediate chance to attack the player,
	  as it would with most spell strikes.

	On movable objects:
	- Striking a punished player's chain (but not the ball) will
	  unpunish you.
	- Unlocks large boxes, chests, and iron safes ("Klick!") and
	  fixes the lock if broken.

	On you:
	- If you are punished, you will receive the message "Your chain
	  quivers for a moment.", and the wand will be identified.

	On immovable objects
	- Reveals and unlocks hidden doors, and unlocks non-hidden doors.
	  The door remains closed.
	- Interrupts attempts to break down a door with a pickaxe or
	  mattock, and repairs the door.
	- If you zap up or down while on a closed portcullis (possible
	  with phasing), it will open.
	- Opens drawbridges.
	- Triggers trapdoors and falling rock traps (only if someone
	  stands on the trap).
	- Releases you or a monster from a bear trap or a web. The
	  monster may be pacified if adjacent.

	Breaking:
	- No explosion. A Trap Door may be created when this wand is
	  broken. The more charges on the wand the higher the chance of
	  creating the trap.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of poison gas
	Similar to the poison breath attack of a green dragon, zapping
	this wand shoots a ray of poison gas.
	- Monsters hit by the initial ray take 6d6 poison damage.
	- The ray leaves a trail of poison gas that lingers for a few
	  turns before dissapating.
	- The acid ray can rebound off walls.
	- Poison resistance negates this damage, as does unbreathing.
	- Doors hit by the ray will be rotted away.

	Breaking:
	- Results in a 3x3 cloud of poison gas centered around the player.
	- A Magic Beam Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The
	  more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating a trap.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- Creates a single cloud of poison gas when engraving.
wand of polymorph
	- Zapping the wand in a direction will polymorph any monsters or
	  items in its path.
	- Zapping the wand at yourself will polymorph you, ignoring magic
	  resistance.
	- Monsters can zap this wand at themselves, but mercifully, this
	  will not generate out-of-depth monsters.

	- Wands of polymorph are immune to polymorphing from other sources,
	  such as a potion of polymorph.

	Breaking:
	- Causes an explosion that deals 1 to (4 x charges) damage and
	  polymorphs monsters and items on affected squares; this
	  ignores magic resistance for the player.
	-  A Polymorph Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The
	  more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating the trap.

	Engraving: Dust
	- If an engraving already exists on your square, this wand will
	  instead transform the writing into a random rumor.
wand of probing
	- A wand of probing can give you information about a monster, or
	  the contents of a container.
	- When zapped, it will probe all targets in the path of its beam
	  It also has other uses.

	- In general, wands of probing act much like stethoscopes.
	- Zapping one prompts the player for a direction, and if there is
	  a suitable target, shows the name, alignment, level, HP, AC,
	  and status of the target.
	- Like a stethoscope, it does not anger peaceful targets.
	- Unlike a stethoscope, it is a directional beam, allowing the
	  remote assessment of the target, and it will also show the
	  inventory of the target.

	Breaking: No effects.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of secret door detection
	When zapped, the wand has the same effect as a spell of detect
	unseen: it detects all undiscovered secret doors, mimics, and
	traps in a radius of 8 squares in line-of-sight upon
	zapping/engraving.

	- It will also show the location of submerged creatures in pools.
	- On the Plane of Air only, the wand also penetrates clouds.

	- Nearby monsters that you can't see due to invisibility will be
	  revealed as I.
	- Marks on spaces without monsters are removed, and monsters that
	  are hiding will be revealed.

	Breaking:
	- Chance of detecting traps and magic portals
	- Requires at least 2 charges to be successful, the more charges
	  the higher the chance of a successful detection.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- Engraving with the wand will only auto-identify it if any of
      these things are present; otherwise, it gives no message.
wand of sleep
	When zapped, it emits a sleep ray
	- puts monsters it hits to sleep for 6d25 turns, unless they resist.
	- Rays of sleep can bounce from walls and unrevealed secret doors,
	  but are absorbed by non-secret or discovered secret doors.
	- If you zap yourself, you are put to sleep for 1d50 turns (the
	  amount of sleep resistance you have can reduce this)
	Breaking:
	- A Sleeping Gas Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The
	  more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating the
	  trap.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- When engraving, this wand gives the same message as a wand of
	  death. If the wand was not generated in a monster's inventory,
	  the odds are 6:1 for it being sleep.
wand of slow monster
	This wand inflicts slowness on monsters (makes them take more
	turns to move or attack).

	Monsters have a chance to resist the wand's effect, given by
			MR / (112 - difficulty)

	- If the monster does not resist, it becomes slow (2/3 of normal
	  movement speed), or normal speed if it was previously fast. If
	  you were engulfed by a whirly monster (vortex or air elemental),
	  you are expelled.

	- If you zap yourself with a wand of slow monster, you will
	  become slow for 13-23 turns and abuse dexterity.

	Breaking:
	- Results in an explosion causing from 1 to (4 x charges) damage.
	  You and surrounding monsters are slowed.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of noise
	When zapped, it emits a ray of sound.
	- Deals 6d6 damage to monsters in its path.
	- Sonic rays can bounce from walls and will destroy doors, iron
	  bars, and drawbridges.

	- Monsters hit by sonic rays are subject to sonic damage, which
	  can destroy glass and crystal items.
	- All potions are glass, so they are always vulnerable to breaking.
	  Rings, wands, and tools are all vulnerable to this damage if
	  made of glass or crystal.

	Sonic Resistance is obtainable by wearing a ring of sonic
	resistance.

	Zapping self:
	- Deals 6d6 sonic damage and subjects your inventory to sonic
	  destruction. Also causes deafness for 100-399 turns.

	Breaking:
	- Creates an explosion that deals (16 x charges) damage to
	  yourself and all monsters on the surrounding squares. Your
	  inventory is subject to the same effects as though you were
	  zapped with the wand.
	- A Magic Beam Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The
	  more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating a trap.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- The wand will issue some loud bands and wakeup nearby monsters.
wand of speed monster
	Zapping the wand at a monster gives the target(s) permanent
	intrinsic speed. Zapping the wand at yourself grants temporary
	intrinsic speed for 50-74 turns and also exercises dexterity.

	Monsters can zap the wand at themselves, and observing them doing
	so will auto-identify it. Monsters that you zap with this wand are
	capable of resisting its effect, dependent on a check against
	their magic resistance value; zapping a peaceful monster will
	anger it.

	Breaking:
	- There is an explosion causing from 1 to (4 x charges) damage.
      You and surrounding monsters are sped up.

	Engraving: Dust.
wand of striking
	Zapping this wand has the same effect as the force bolt spell
	- deals 2d12 damage to any monsters in its path
	- Destroys boulders, doors, statues, drawbridges, and fragile
	  items such as potions.
	- Its beam does not reflect

	Wands of striking have a fixed chance of hitting:
	- if the roll of a d20 is lower than (10 + monster's AC), the
	  strike hits.
	- If the damage output is sufficiently high enough (16 hit points
	  of damage or greater) the bolt will knock its target back one
	  tile space.

	- A wand of striking will normally have no effect on items carried
	  by monsters. However, if the zap kills a monster, it will also
	  strike the items that the monster drops. This makes zapping
	  nymphs dangerous, because they are weak enough to be killed by
	  a single zap, and tend to carry mirrors that give a −2 luck
	  penalty when broken.

	- Possessing Magic Resistance renders the striking damage
	  harmless. ("Boing!")

	Breaking:
	- Causes an explosion causing from 1 to (charges+1)d6 damage. You
	  and surrounding monsters are hit by a force bolt. Fragile
	  objects in your and adjacent squares may be destroyed.

	Engraving: Dust
wand of teleportation
	Zapping this wand in a direction will teleport all monsters and
	items in the path of the wand.

	- You can teleport other monsters away even on no-teleport levels.
	- Zapping a peaceful monster with this wand will anger it.
	- Zapping the wand at yourself will teleport you and all items on
	  your square.

	- When fleeing, monsters may zap themselves with this wand to
	  escape.
	- On a no-teleport level, a monster will zap you with a wand of
	  teleportation just once, wasting a charge, and will not try to
	  teleport you again.

	- Teleporting the Riders has a 12/13 chance of teleporting them
	  to a square as close as possible to you; attempting to teleport
	  away the Riders' corpses will cause them to immediately revive,
	  but will not teleport them.

	Breaking:
	- Causes an explosion causing from 1 to (4 x charges) damage.
	  Monsters and objects in the affected squares are teleported.
	- A Teleport Trap may be created when this wand is broken. The
	  more charges on the wand the higher the chance of creating a trap.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- Engraving with a wand of teleportation will make any previous
	  engraving vanish; unlike the wand of cancellation and make
	  invisible, however, you can find the engraving elsewhere on the
	  level.
wand of undead turning
	A wand of undead turning has two functions:

	1) Zapping an undead monster deals 1d8 points of damage and will
	   cause the creature to flee from you. This damage is doubled if
	   you are a Knight carrying the Magic Mirror of Merlin.

	2) Alternatively, the wand can be used to unturn dead, reviving
	   corpses and rejuvenating eggs, though limitations apply.
	   Monsters will not use this wand.

	Intelligent monsters with hands that have a wand of undead turning
	will zap you with it if you are carrying any corpses, including
	lizard corpses or wielded cockatrice corpses. When they do, one
	corpse from each stack you are carrying will be revived.

	Breaking:
	- There is an explosion causing from 1 to (4 x charges) damage.
	  Monsters and objects in the affected squares are turned.

	Engraving: Dust
wand of deluge
	Similar to the breath of a sea dragon, this zaps a torrent of
	water that slams into its target, inflicting 6d8 physical damage.

	Zapping yourself: Drenches you and your items in water.

	Zapping monsters:
	- Monsters hit by this wand also have their armor subject to rusting.
	- Iron or steel golems are instakilled (via rusting)
	- If you are engulfed by an Ice Vortex and you zap this wand, you
	will be instantly killed by turning into a block of ice.
	- If you zap a water elemental, you will instead heal it for 6d6 HP.
	- If you zap an earth elemental, it turns into a mud elemental.

	- Amphibious and breathless monsters are not affected by water streams.
    - Monsters that like fire or lava (ex: fire vortex, lava demon)
      take an extra 6d6 damage. (If the monster is also amphibious
      or unbreathing, this vulnerability takes priority.

    - Monsters can use this wand and will attack you if you are a
      vulnerable firey form.
    - Lamps or lit items that are in the path of the water beam will
      be snuffed.

    - Zapping the floor wipes away any engravings.

	- If a ray of water hits a forge, it will destroy it.

	Breaking:
	- There is also chance of creating a Rust Trap when this wand is
	  broken. The more charges on the wand the higher the chance of
	  creating the trap.

	Engraving:
wand of wind
	Can blow monsters away, or blow a hole in a whirly monster
	e ngulfing you.

	- If any items are hit by the blast of wind, they will be scattered.

	- hurtles you in a random direction when zapped at self.

	If you are polymorphed into a whirly monster and are zapped by
	this wand, you will be changed back to your base form and your
	constitution is abused. If you have unchanging on, you'll suffer
	5d6 damage.

	Breaking:
	- Stirs up an explosion of wind around you causing from 1 to
	  (4 x charges) damage. Sends all adjacent objects flying and
	attempts to hurtle monsters.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- Wipes out the current engraving and blows any objects on your
	  square away.
wand of wishing
	- When zapped or engraved with, if the player's Luck is non-
	  negative, the wand will auto-identify and allow the player to
	  make a guaranteed wish.
	- Note that wishing will increase your prayer timeout.

	- You cannot wish for a wand of wishing; this will give you a
	  pre-charged wand of wishing with -1 charges (i.e. cancelled)
	  with a 90% chance. The remaining 10% will result in a precharged
	  wand with zero charges.

	- The wand is unusual because it can only be recharged once; it
	  always explodes if you try to recharge it a second time.
	- Wands of wishing are always generated charged once (except the
	  Castle wand)

	Breaking: No effects.

	Engraving: Dust.
	- The wand will prompt you for a wish when you attempt to engrave
	  with it.
wand of wonder
	When zapped, engraved, or broken, this wand chooses a random
	effect from the list of ALL wands every time it is used.

	- If you zap a monster or object(s), the result will be very
	unpredictable due to the randomization of effects.

	- If a Wand of Wishing is chosen as the random effect, there is
	  an additional 1 in 100 roll to pass in order to actually get a
	  wish, otherwise the effect is changed to a Wand of Poison Gas.
	- If a Wand of Nothing is chosen as the random effect, it is
	  instead changed to a Wand of Death.
	- If another Wand of Wonder is chosen as the random effect, it is
	  instead changed to a Wand of Polymorph.

	Zapping self:
	- Currently the wand of wonder is limited to these effects if you
	  zap yourself: lightning, magic missile, polymorph, undead
	  turning, teleportation, and death, but it will still be random.

	Breaking: Breaking this wand also is subject to a random wand
	  explosion.

	Engraving: The wand of wonder also uses a random wand effect on each engrave.
warden arianna
	I believe in two things: discipline and the Bible.  Here you'll
	receive both.  Put your trust in the Lord; your ass belongs to me.
	Welcome to Shawshank.

warg
	Suddenly Aragorn leapt to his feet.  "How the wind howls!"
	he cried.  "It is howling with wolf-voices.  The Wargs have
	come west of the Mountains!"
	"Need we wait until morning then?" said Gandalf.  "It is as I
	said.  The hunt is up!  Even if we live to see the dawn, who
	now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves
	on his trail?"
	"How far is Moria?" asked Boromir.
	"There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles
	as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,"
	answered Gandalf grimly.
	"Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,"
	said Boromir.  "The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc
	that one fears."
	"True!" said Aragorn, loosening his sword in its sheath.  "But
	where the warg howls, there also the orc prowls."
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
~mjollnir
*war*hammer
	They had come together at the ford of the Trident while the
	battle crashed around them, Robert with his warhammer and his

water
	Day after day, day after day,

water demon
	[ The monkey king ] walked along the bank, around the pond.
	He examined the footprints of the animals that had gone into
	the water, and saw that none came out again!  So he realized
	this pond must be possessed by a water demon.  He said to the
	80,000 monkeys, "This pond is possessed by a water demon.  Do
	not let anybody go into it."

	After a little while, the water demon saw that none of the
	monkeys went into the water to drink.  So he rose out of the
	middle of the pond, taking the shape of a frightening monster.
	He had a big blue belly, a white face with bulging green eyes,
	and red claws and feet.  He said, "Why are you just sitting
	around?  Come into the pond and drink at once!"

	The monkey king said to the horrible monster, "Are you the
	water demon who owns this pond?"  "Yes, I am," said he.  "Do
	you eat whoever goes into the water?" asked the king.  "Yes,
	I do," he answered, "including even birds.  I eat them all.
	And when you are forced by your thirst to come into the pond
	and drink, I will enjoy eating you, the biggest monkey, most
	of all!"  He grinned, and saliva dripped down his hairy chin.
		[ Buddhist Tales for Young and Old, Vol. 1 ]
*water walking*
	And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto
	thee on the water. And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out
	of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus. But when he saw
	the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried,
	saying, Lord, save me. And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand,
	and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
	didst thou doubt? And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

water troll
	It wasn't that the troll was _horrifying_. Instead of the
	rotting, betentacled monstrosity he had been expecting
	Rincewind found himself looking at a rather squat but not
	particularly ugly old man who would quite easily have passed
	for normal on any city street, always provided that other
	people on the street were used to seeing old men who were
	apparently composed of water and very little else. It was as
	if the ocean had decided to create life without going through
	all that tedious business of evolution, and had simply formed
	a part of itself into a biped and sent it walking squishily up
	the beach. The troll was a pleasant translucent blue color.
	As Rincewind stared a small shoal of silver fish flashed
	across its chest.

# magic whistle deserves its own entry
pea whistle
tin whistle
	A pea whistle is a simple nonmagical and non-tonal instrument and
	appears as a whistle when unidentified.

	Applying a pea whistle of any beatitude can wake nearby monsters
	from sleep; if your pet is close enough to hear the noise, then
	for the next five turns it will try to approach you more closely.
	Additionally, using a cursed pea whistle in a vault will
	immediately summon a guard.

	The range of a pea whistle is sqrt(xlvl*20), which in practice is
	half the range of a leather drum. This results in a radius of
	about 4 squares at XL 1, 16 squares at XL 14, and a maximum of 24
	squares at XL 30.

	You can upgrade pea whistles into magic whistles, making them far
	more useful in general.

	There were legends both on the front and on the back of the
	whistle. The one read thus:

	FLA FUR BIS FLE The other: QUIS EST ISTE QUI VENIT
	'I ought to be able to make it out,' he thought;
	'but I suppose I am a little rusty in my Latin.
	When I come to think of it, I don't believe I even
	know the word for a whistle. The long one does seem
	simple enough. It ought to mean, "Who is this who is coming?"

	Well, the best way to find out is evidently to whistle
	for him.'

*wight
	A wight is a fearsome undead spirit inhabiting the remains of a
	deceased humanoid. Due to their corporeal nature, wights are able
	to make use of both weapons and magic.

	When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall
	nothing except a sense of dread.  Then suddenly he knew that
	he was imprisoned, caught hopelessly; he was in a barrow.  A
	Barrow-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under
	the dreadful spells of the Barrow-wights about which whispered
	tales spoke.  He dared not move, but lay as he found himself:
	flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his
	breast.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
wizard of yendor
	No one knows how old this mighty wizard is, or from whence he
	came.  It is known that, having lived a span far greater than
	any normal man's, he grew weary of lesser mortals; and so,
	spurning all human company, he forsook the dwellings of men
	and went to live in the depths of the Earth.  He took with
	him a dreadful artifact, the Book of the Dead, which is said
	to hold great power indeed.  Many have sought to find the
	wizard and his treasure, but none have found him and lived to
	tell the tale.  Woe be to the incautious adventurer who

mist wolf
	This hazy canine  (_canis precipitous_) is  thought to  have a good

	filling, at least compared to human flesh.

	blue or white flowers with large hoodlike upper sepals, and an

~*purple worm
*worm
long worm tail
	  Where the dunes began, perhaps fifty metres away at the foot of a

	resolved into a giant, questing mouth. It was a round, black hole
	with edges glistening in the moonlight.
	  The mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica

	Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim
	and dark, the shapes became terribly clear.  He was able to
	see beneath their black wrappings.  There were five tall
	figures:  two standing on the lip of the dell, three advancing.
	In their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under
	their mantles were long grey robes; upon their grey hairs
	were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were swords of
	steel.  Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they
	rushed towards him.  Desperate, he drew his own sword, and
	it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if it was a
	firebrand.  Two of the figures halted.  The third was taller
	than the others:  his hair was long and gleaming and on his
	helm was a crown.  In one hand he held a long sword, and in
	the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
	glowed with a pale light.  He sprang forward and bore down
	on Frodo.

	small, and one of the most difficult of all is how it got that
	awful name.  The creature is neither particularly abominable,
	nor does it necessarily live in the snows.  _Yeti_ is a Tibetan
	word which may apply either to a real, but unknown animal of
	the Himalayas, or to a mountain spirit or demon -- no one is
	quite sure which.  And after nearly half a century in which

Cleaver
	Attacks in a wide arc and can hit multiple monsters in an arc
	with one swing: each attack will first strike the monster 45
	degrees to one side of your target, then the targeted monster,
	and then the monster 45 degrees to the other side. The direction
	of attack alternates with each swing. The arc does not
	discriminate between hostile monsters and pets or peaceful
	monsters. If attacking while held or engulfed, you can only hit
	the monster holding or engulfing you.
Magicbane
    A highly enchanted athame said to hold the power to channel
	and direct magical energy.

    - Evilhack change: Magic fanfare unbalances victims in addition
      to doing some damage.
    - Putting Magicbane into a bag of holding runs a risk of exploding
      the bag and destroying the artifact due to Magicbane's
      cancellation magic.

    Special attacks:
    - hitting a monster with it has a 40% chance of inflicting a
      magical effect and dealing +1d4 damage to the victim in that
      order, subject to monster MR or player-style magic resistance.
      When thrown, Magicbane will do the same to a monster it hits,
      though this is obviously impractical.[1] The probability of each
      applicable magical effect is determined by Magicbane's
      enchantment - Magicbane will react as follows when enchanted to
      certain thresholds:

        "Your right hand itches!"
            Magicbane's has been enchanted to +0 or +1.
        "Your right hand flinches."
            Magicbane has been enchanted to +2 or above.

    - There are 4 "bonus" effects that Magicbane can produce upon
      hitting, with details listed below:

    Probe monster:
    - Reveals the monster's HP, AC and inventory as if zapped with a
      wand of probing.
     - 'Replaces' other effects as enchantment increases
    Stun monster
    - Stuns the attacked monster.
    - Odds drop significantly once Magicbane is enchanted
    Scare monster
    - Scares the attacked monster.
    - Odds drop significantly once enchanted past +2
    Cancel monster
    - Cancels the attacked monster as if zapped with the spell or wand of cancellation;
    - absorbs energy and increases current and maximum energy by 1.
    - Odds drop significantly once enchanted past +2
    - Absorption occurs regardless of if the target is already canceled
Mjollnir
    Mjollnir can be thrown when wielded if hero has 25 Strength
    (usually via gauntlets of power but possible with rings of
    gain strength).  If the thrower is a Valkyrie, Mjollnir will
    usually (99%) return and then usually (separate 99%) be caught
    and automatically be re-wielded.  When returning Mjollnir is
    not caught, there is a 50:50 chance of hitting hero for damage
    and its lightning shock might destroy some wands and/or rings.

    Monsters don't throw Mjollnir regardless of strength (not even
    fake-player valkyries).
Dirge
    - From SporkHack, but with a twist.
    - This is the anti-Excalibur, the "Dark Knight's sword"
    - Only chaotic knights can dip for Dirge.
    - Can only be obtained by chaotic Knights by sacrificing a same
      race monster on a co-aligned altar while wielding a type of
      long sword (the exact type makes no difference, Dirge will
      become a 'long sword' regardless). Must have positive alignment.
    - You can throw Dirge at iron bars to dissolve them.
    - If it has not yet been generated, Graz'zt gets Dirge.
The Ring of P\'hul
    Based loosely off of the Ring of P'hul - from 'The Lords of Dus' series
    by Lawrence Watt-Evans. This is another one of those artifacts that would
    just be ridiculous if its full power were realized in-game. In the series,
    it deals out death and disease. Here it will protect the wearer from a
    good portion of that. Making this the quest artifact for the Barbarian role.
    This artifact also corrects an oversight from vanilla, that no chaotic-based
    artiafcts conferred magic resistance, a problem that was compounded if our
    hero is in a form that can't wear body armor or cloaks. So, we make the
    Barbarian artifact chaotic (why it was neutral before is a bit confusing
    to me as most vanilla Barbarian race/role combinations are chaotic).

    Chained blitz is a complicated but powerful technique. It allows
    you to chain together a series of known techniques by using key
    combinations. Note that the same combination of keys cannot be
    used twice in a row.

    Valid chained blitz techniues fall into three categories:
    - Starter: Can be followed by any category.
    - Chain: Can be followed by chains and finishers.
    - Finisher: Can be followed only by finishers.

    The number of techniques you can chain together starts out at
    two, and increases for every multiple of ten levels, up to a
    maximum of five at level 30.
pummel
    The pummel technique allows you to unleash a flurry of
    rapid attacks on your foes.

    This technique is considered a chain for the chained blitz
    techique. Motion: L,R,L / R,L,R
ground slam
    The ground slam technique allows you to bury your opponent in
    the earth, by means of slamming them into the ground.

    This technique is considered a finisher for the chained blitz
    techique. Motion: D,D,D,D
air dash
    This technique allows you to fling yourself forward twice the
    normal amount in a turn.

    This technique is considered a starter for the chained blitz
    techique. Motion: L,L / R,R
power surge
    The power surge technique allows the user to enter an enlightened state,
    granting them a very large amount of power, at the exchange of
    slowly losing that power over time.

    This technique is considered a starter for the chained blitz
    techique. Motion: >,>,>,>
spirit bomb
    The spirit bomb technique creates a deadly explosion of
    concentrated, destructive chi.

    This technique is considered a finisher for the chained blitz
    techique. Motion: U,U,U,U,D
draw blood
    Draw blood is a technique that allows a vampire to exchange experience
    for potions of vampire blood.
jedi jump
    Every Jedi can do the Jedi Jump, channeling the force to jump forward
    like unskilled spell at level 1, basic at level 5, skilled at level
    10, and expert at level 15. This technique is reusable after 50 turns
    and uses up 25 energy.
charge saber
    The charge saber technique lets a jedi recharge their lightsaber 
    when it has run out of power.  If they are at least technique 
    level 10, they have a 20% chance of channeling the force perfectly 
    into the saber, thus giving it an additional 1500 turns. 
    
    In order for the technique to succeed, the Jedi must remain 
    uninterrupted for 10 turns.
force push
    Force Push is a technique that Jedi can use to thrust their opponents
    back in battle. As you gain higher levels and more control over the
    force, the range and distance you can hurtle monsters back grows.
curse tech*
    Curse is a technique that Infidels start with. It can can used to
    uncurse or curse items. 


tumble
    Tumbling allows the user to switch places with an opponent, and is useful for
    getting out of dangerous situations. Note that tumbling costs at least one
    turn, however.
sunder
    Sunder allows the user to attempt to destroy the weapons or equipment of a foe.
blood magic
    Blood magic allows you to draw on your own life force to cast spells. If you
    would normally not have enough energy to cast a spell, you can cast it using
    your own hit points as a power source.

	Archeology is the search for fact, not truth. [...]
	So forget any ideas you've got about lost cities, exotic travel,
	and digging up the world. We do not follow maps to buried
	treasure, and X never, ever, marks the spot.
		[ Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade ]

	"I cannot be having with archeological excavations, myself,"
	I said.  "The fellows who dig them only ever find tiny walls
	and a few bits of broken pottery, and then they get all
	excited and swear that they have just made the most
	important discovery of the century, the ruins of a mile-high
	gold-covered temple to Frogmore the God of Bike-Saddle
	Fixtures or some such."
	"I think you will find," said Mr Rune, "that they do this
	in order to secure further government funding for their
	diggings and so remain in employment."
	"That is a rather cynical view," I said.

 	They dressed alike -- in buckskin boots, leathern breeks and
 	deerskin shirts, with broad girdles that held axes and short
 	swords; and they were all gaunt and scarred and hard-eyed;
 	sinewy and taciturn.
 	They were wild men, of a sort, yet there was still a wide
 	gulf between them and the Cimmerian.  They were sons of
 	civilization, reverted to a semi-barbarism.  He was a
 	barbarian of a thousand generations of barbarians.  They had
 	acquired stealth and craft, but he had been born to these

	We must especially observe that this heresy, witchcraft, not only
	differs from all other heresy in this, that not merely by a tacit
	compact, but by a compact which is exactly defined and expressed
	it blasphemes the Creator and endeavours to the utmost to profane Him
	and to harm His creatures, for all other simple heresies have made
	no open compact with the devil, no compact, that is, either tacit
	or exactly expressed, although their errors and misbelief are directly
	to be attributed to the Father of errors and lies.  Moreover,
	maleficium (witchcraft) differs from all other harmful and mysterious
	arts in this point, that of all superstition it is essentially
	the vilest, the most evil and the worst, wherefore it derives its name
	from doing evil, and from blaspheming the true faith.

	One day, an army general invited the Buddhist monk I-Hsiu
	(literally, "One Rest") to his military head office for a
	dinner.  I-Hsiu was not accustomed to wearing luxurious
	clothings and so he just put on an old ordinary casual
	robe to go to the military base.  To him, "form is void".

	As he approached the base, two soldiers appeared before him
	and shouted, "Where does this beggar came from?  Identify
	yourself!  You do not have permission to be around here!"

	"My name is I-Hsiu Dharma Master.  I am invited by your
	general for a supper."

	The two soldiers examined the monk closely and said, "You
	liar.  How come my general invites such a shabby monk to
	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"

	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.

	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his mouth, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.
	You do not invite me for a dinner.  You invite my robe.
	Therefore, my robe is eating the food, not me."

	[...]  For the two priests were talking exactly like priests,
	piously, with learning and leisure, about the most aerial
	enigmas of theology.  The little Essex priest spoke the more
	simply, with his round face turned to the strengthening stars;
	the other talked with his head bowed, as if he were not even
	worthy to look at them.  But no more innocently clerical
	conversation could have been heard in any white Italian cloister
	or black Spanish cathedral.  The first he heard was the tail of
	one of Father Brown's sentences, which ended:  "... what they
	really meant in the Middle Ages by the heavens being
	incorruptible."  The taller priest nodded his bowed head and
	said:  "Ah, yes, these modern infidels appeal to their reason;
	but who can look at those millions of worlds and not feel that
	there may well be wonderful universes above us where reason is
	utterly unreasonable?"

    I understand the business, I hear it: to have an open ear, a

    By that time, Narahara had already slipped his arm from the
    sleeve of his outer robe, drew out his two-and-a-half-foot
    Fujiwara Tadahiro sword, and, brandishing it over his head,
    began barreling toward the foreigners.  In less than a minute,
    he had charged upon them and cut one of them through the torso.
    The man fled, clutching his bulging guts, finally to fall from
    his horse at the foot of a pine tree about a thousand yards
    away.  Kaeda Takeji finished him off.  The other two Englishmen
    were severely wounded as they tried to flee.  Only the woman
    managed to escape virtually unscathed.

	The road from Ankh-Morpork to Chrim is high, white and
	winding, a thirty-league stretch of potholes and half-buried
	rocks that spirals around mountains and dips into cool green
	valleys of citrus trees, crosses liana-webbed gorges on
	creaking rope bridges and is generally more picturesque than
	useful.
	Picturesque.  That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard
	(BMgc, Unseen University [failed]).  It was one of a number
	he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of
	Ankh-Morpork.  Quaint was another one.  Picturesque meant --
	he decided after careful observation of the scenery that
	inspired Twoflower to use the word -- that the landscape was
	horribly precipitous.  Quaint, when used to describe the
	occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-
	ridden and tumbledown.

	The Valkyries were the thirteen choosers of the slain, the
	beautiful warrior-maids of Odin who rode through the air and
	over the sea.  They watched the progress of the battle and
	selected the heroes who were to fall fighting.  After they
	were dead, the maidens rewarded the heroes by kissing them
	and then led their souls to Valhalla, where the warriors
	lived happily in an ideal existence, drinking and eating
	without restraint and fighting over again the battles in
	which they died and in which they had won their deathless
	fame.

	Ebenezum walked before me along the closest thing we could
	find to a path in these overgrown woods.  Every few paces he
	would pause, so that I, burdened with a pack stuffed with
	arcane and heavy paraphernalia, could catch up with his
	wizardly strides.  He, as usual, carried nothing, preferring,
	as he often said, to keep his hands free for quick conjuring
	and his mind free for the thoughts of a mage.

	Found mainly near the frozen wastes of the north, the Ice Mages
	are a mysterious group of individuals who are rumored to be
	descendants of a once great northern civilization that fell into
	chaos over a thousand years ago.
	They wield the power of elemental cold, a conglomeration of elemental
	air and water.  They are particularly effective fighting fire-based
	creatures. Although they command of two of the four elements, Ice Mages
	have difficulty affecting undead, who are immune to cold.

    Necromancy is the practice of magic or black magic involving
    communication with the dead by summoning their spirits as
    apparitions or visions, or by resurrection for the purpose of
    divination; imparting the means to foretell future events;
    discovery of hidden knowledge; returning a person to life, or to
    use the dead as a weapon. Sometimes referred to as "death magic,"
    the term is used in a more general sense to refer to black magic
    or witchcraft.

	Yeoman is a noun originally referring either to one who	owns and
	cultivates land or to the middle ranks of servants in an English
	royal or noble household. The term was first documented in mid-
	14th-century England. The 14th century also witnessed the
	rise of the yeoman longbow archer during the Hundred Years' War,
	and the yeoman outlaws celebrated in the Robin Hood ballads.
	Yeomen also joined the English Navy during the Hundred Years' War
	as seamen and archers.

    In the early 15th century, yeoman was the rank of chivalry between
    page and squire. By the late 17th century, yeoman became a rank in
    the new Royal Navy for the common seamen who were in charge of
    ship's stores, such as foodstuffs, gunpowder, and sails.
